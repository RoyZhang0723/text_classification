It is assumed that construction contractors and subcontractors play a great part in adopting or neglecting an innovative technology due to different factors. We believe this reluctance attribute would be a common factor between these two groups of construction actors and it would further be an indication of sort of behavior these groups have in common. This study intends to make a major contribution to the body of knowledge by investigating BIM feasibility for SMEs. The research method consists of application of a structured online questionnaire distributed Online, out of which 70 responses from the industry were collected and analyzed. Inferential statistics, and hypothesis testing were applied to check the associations among categorical variables via Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test and Mann-Whitney U Test. The factors between contractors and subcontractors in terms of organizational, technological, economic, and social attributes were compared. Further, contractors were grouped in terms of BIM and software usage, firm size, and partnership by Cluster Analysis. The results show the rankings for contractors were different from the rankings for subcontractors with respect to technological feasibility and the rankings of contractors were all higher than those of subcontractors when partnership was introduced as a differentiating variable.","[Sadeh, Hooman; Mirarchi, Claudio; Pavan, Alberto] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Milan, Italy; [Shahbodaghlou, Farzad] Dept Engn, Hayward, CA USA","Sadeh, H (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Milan, Italy.",hsadeh5@gmail.com,,"Sadeh, Hooman/0000-0003-2033-1600",,,,36,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

However, because of the competitive nature of the construction industry, this traditional arrangement can result in adversarial relationships between general contractors and subcontractors, which can jeopardize potential or ongoing collaborative construction plans. To avoid this problem, close, long-term relationships between general contractors and subcontractors, as in strategic partnerships, must be established. Unfortunately, forming and sustaining such relationships can be time-consuming and cost-intensive. Furthermore, this type of relationship does not necessarily enhance cooperation or work performance. For contractors to successfully establish effective partnerships with their subcontractors, they must select the appropriate relationship by considering the different characteristics of the subcontracted work involved. Based on transaction cost theory, the findings of this study show that transaction costs incurred by general contractors and subcontractors vary according to the type of relationship established. Therefore, for the purpose of comparing transaction costs incurred in both competitive and partnership relationships, transaction-cost-based profit models for both general contractors and subcontractors are developed, respectively, for each relationship type. As well, by applying different strategies to maximize profits in each relationship, and by simulating the parameters affecting the nature of the subcontracted work, the conditions and relationships under which general contractors' profits are optimized have been determined. Finally, based on simulation, practical guidelines for choosing the most appropriate relationship type are proposed.","[Lee, Hyun-soo; Park, Moonseo; Kwon, Soon-seok] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Architecture, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Seo, Joon-oh] Hanmiparsons Co Ltd, Construct Strateg Res Inst, Seoul 135090, South Korea; [Ryu, Han-guk] Changwon Natl Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Chang Won 641773, Gyeongnam, South Korea","Park, M (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Architecture, 39-433,San 56-1 Shinlim Dong, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",hyunslee@snu.ac.kr; cico81@naver.com; mspark@snu.ac.kr; hgryu@changwon.ac.kr; dreamkss1@snu.ac.kr,"Seo, JoonOh/O-5530-2015; SEO, JoonOh/AAY-8665-2020","Seo, JoonOh/0000-0002-5377-7142; SEO, JoonOh/0000-0002-5377-7142",,,,16,14,14,1,34,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

This was observed from past research that identified the link between design decisions and fatalities. The concept of implementing design decisions that positively affect safety falls under the general concept of prevention through design (PtD), which attempts to identify and mitigate hazards early in the design process to eliminate the risks of injury or damage during construction. Prevention through design is practiced in other countries, primarily through legislation. The objective of this paper is to present the results of a survey that was conducted to identify construction industry stakeholders' views on the concept of PtD and gauge the possibility for implementing PtD in the U.S. construction industry through either legislation or other means. Four distinct groups were surveyed: engineers, architects, contractors, and owners. Within this study, PtD was described and introduced to survey participants as design for construction worker safety (DCWS) to differentiate PtD efforts in construction from efforts in other industries. The survey consisted of questions that asked about the industry's knowledge of PtD and the extent of PtD practice in the United States, participants' opinions on designer and owner safety knowledge and perceptions, and obstacles and enablers for designer participation in construction safety. The responses from the various groups were compared to identify the groups that are more receptive to the idea of designer participation in construction worker safety. The results showed that architects were the least receptive to the idea, whereas the other groups were more likely to be supportive, with some hesitations. Architects and engineers identified the existence of economic, legal, and contractual obstacles for designers to practice DCWS, whereas contractors only identified economic obstacles. No enablers were identified by any group. The research contributes additional information that can be used by construction industry practitioners and organizations desiring to expand and optimize PtD implementation in the United States. The research results can be used by project teams to plan for PtD education and training efforts on projects and by construction industry organizations to develop PtD diffusion strategies.

To date, researchers have modeled these interactions in the context of stand-alone projects. While much has been learned, questions arise concerning the validity of these models, because projects are not islands-they are affected by the markets in which general contractors compete for subcontractor resources. LeapconX is a marketwide simulation that can model an unlimited number of construction projects, subcontractors, and residential building projects in any given market region. It enables testing of production system innovations, revealing the impacts not only on companies implementing the innovations, but also on companies that do not. The system was validated through simulation using data for the Newark, New Jersey metropolitan area. Three production control innovations were tested at three levels of market penetration. Comparison of the results with those of single-project simulations for the same innovations confirms that market dynamics moderate outcomes. LeapconX enables both construction management researchers and practitioners to predict the likely outcomes of a wide variety of procedural and technological innovations, with little cost and no risk to actual projects.

To fill this gap, this paper aims to examine the relationships between safety leaderships of project owners, contractors and subcontractors and discover leadership dimensions which significantly impact construction safety performance. An impacting mechanism involving owner safety leadership, contractor safety leadership and subcontractor safety leadership are hypothetically proposed and empirically tested. The results show that significant relationships exist between safety leaderships of the three key stakeholders. Project safety culture acts as a significant mediator in these relationships. In addition, among all leadership dimensions of owners and contractors, safety influence and role modeling has the widest range of influence on project safety culture and other stakeholders' safety leadership. As such, it is suggested that owners and contractors should cultivate charisma and the ability of being influential about ideals in project managers and require them to behave as role models for others. The results also show that the caring dimension of leadership is more required in the frontline environment. Supervisors need more attention and support from the contractor in their well-being and organizational identification for the project. In conclusion, this paper establishes clear leadership impacting paths from owners to site supervisors of subcontractors in construction projects, which provides insights into effective ways to implement managerial measures and publicize policies and values to construction sites.

Surprisingly, despite the criticality of the subcontractor/principal contractor relationship to successful project out-comes, research into this important relationship has been fragmented, disorganised and under-theorised. Mobil-ising theories of relationship quality to address this gap in knowledge, a survey of three hundred and thirty seven tier-one subcontractors in the Australian construction industry was undertaken to explore what factors influence relationship quality between subcontractors and principal contractors, whether these factors vary across the sup-ply chain and how they affect overall relational satisfaction. The findings give subcontractors a missing voice in this important debate and provide a more nuanced understanding of this critical project relationship from a novel theoretical perspective. They indicate that from a subcontractor perspective, subcontractor/principal contractor relationship quality is determined by six key factors: integrity respect and fairness; prompt payment; willingness to negotiate risk and price; effective communication; concern for worker health, safety and well-being; and op-portunities for early involvement in planning and design. Conceptually, when these factors are organised under the three dimensions of relationship quality theory (trust, satisfaction, and commitment), the results show that trust is by far the most important determinant of relationship quality. However, subcontractors cannot be treated as a homogeneous group and the factors that influence relationship quality and the importance of trust vary sig-nificantly between large and small subcontractors and by the amount of turnover-dependency in a relationship. Conceptually, the findings are important for refining the concept of relationship quality in a project management context and for helping construction project managers to improve often tenuous subcontractor relationships in an increasingly competitive industry where the quality of these relationships is a critical determinant of project outcomes and competitive advantage.","[Martin, Loosemore] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Benson, Lim] UNSW, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Martin, L (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",martin.loosemore@uts.edu.au,,,,,,96,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0263-7863,1873-4634,,INT J PROJ MANAG,Int.

The writers introduce a schedule control method initiated by the subcontractor, which facilitates coordination and communication between a subcontractor and other project participants as well as documentation to the prime contractor. A case study illustrates the preparation of a trade-specific critical path method (CPM) schedule, which is updated on a regular basis. The writers also address the interrelationship between the CPM schedule, internal reporting, schedule of values, and labor tracking. It is difficult to ensure that all subcontractor-produced documentation is complementary, but it is well worth the effort when it comes to supporting a claim. Monthly schedule updates and narratives communicate the conflicts, issues, and schedule constraints the subcontractor experiences or anticipates on a project, thereby providing contractually required notice to the prime contractor during the project. This increases the likelihood of resolving issues during the project, while simultaneously protecting a subcontractor's position if change order requests are denied or if back charges are levied prompting a subcontractor to enforce its rights, execute a claim, or proceed to litigation.","Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; QCxP, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","Dossick, CS (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Box 351610, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",cdossick@u.washington.edu; tschunk@consulthts.com,,"Dossick, Carrie Sturts/0000-0003-0925-4579",,,,0,6,6,0,12,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Previous research has acknowledged that social interactions among supervisors and workers shape safety implementation on work sites. However, a detailed examination of the nature and impact of these social interactions has been missing. An ethnographic method was deployed in which a researcher spent approximately 100 h attending four construction sites over a 6-month period. This deep embedded research method enabled the nature and impact of social interactions to be explored. Organized safety walks and informal walk-arounds were attended, during which interactions were observed and conversations were held with project participants, including foremen, professional health and safety advisors, supervisors, and workers. Field notes and comments were subjected to thematic content analysis. Different understandings of safety were apparent, with key differences emerging in relation to the role attributed to the principal contractors' site safety rules. The social ecosystem at the four sites was also embedded within broader construction industry practices, in particular competitive tendering and price-based selection. The results reveal limitations inherent in traditional technical approaches to understanding safety in the construction site environment because these approaches tend to ignore the social and power relations at play. The results reveal that safety at the principal contractor-subcontractor interface is better understood as an emergent property of a complex ecosystem of social relationships and interactions.","[Lingard, Helen; Oswald, David] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia","Lingard, H (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",helen.lingard@rmit.edu.au,,"Oswald, David/0000-0002-3013-5681; Lingard, Helen/0000-0003-3645-8390",,,,57,1,1,1,12,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Against the background of huge construction demand created by modernization (starting in 1868) and the resultant changes in the construction business (building style, materials and project scale), large general contractors and subordinate subcontractors gradually created a distinctive contracting system. The development process of the construction business based on collaboration and not free competition is discussed with particular emphasis on the unique nature of the contracting system using historical- and institutional-based analyses. One of the competitive strengths of general contractors lies with project organization at construction sites. How the subcontracting of building projects is controlled by general contractors and how subcontractors respond to their subordinate position is explored.

WCI is increasingly affecting contractors' ability to conduct business and has already made the costs of performing certain types of work in certain states prohibitively expensive. However, there are a number of strategies construction companies can employ to lower their WCI costs. These include the formation of industry groups, safety programs and lobbying for legislative reform. Groups of like-minded employers pool risk and provide better credit worthiness to potential insurers. Insurers in return are able to reduce marketing costs as well as claims processing and safety costs. An effective safety program can also greatly reduce workplace injuries. Multidepartmental and multilevel teams with the support of top management can help establish, implement, and continuously improve safety programs. Along with voluntary measures that an employer can take, it is essential that employers encourage their legislators to cure the workers' compensation system. In states where legislative reform has taken place, losses and premiums have declined significantly. The writers hope that this paper will encourage construction companies to better understand the control they have over their own WCI costs and the benefits of improving their own safety performance.","UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT DIV ENVIRONM ENGN,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109","Agarwal, P (corresponding author), IBM CONSULTING GRP,27 COMMERCE DR,CRANFORD,NJ 07016, USA.",,,,,,,24,6,7,0,3,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398",0742-597X,,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Findings revealed that the change management process, economic climate, payment practices, perceptions of future work opportunities, job performance and the project-specific context influence trustfulness and trustworthiness of the different parties.

Planning a project without properly incorporating these two performance parameters propagates multifarious defects and accidents in construction projects and this ultimately leads to cost overrun and time delay. In order to deal with quality and safety at the planning stage (along with time and cost), a decision-making model considering time, cost, quality, and safety (TCQS) is developed on the basis of a many-objective evolutionary algorithm (nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III) and presented in this study. An example is illustrated to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model for generating and visualizing the optimal trade-off among TCQS. The proposed model shows better results compared to earlier reported scheduling models. Additionally, the study has also conducted a correlation analysis to identify the interrelationship, if any, among the TCQS components. Furthermore, the solution obtained from the model was put through sensitivity analysis. The developed model was also checked for two large-scale scheduling cases and found to work efficiently. The inclusion of objectives like quality and safety will provide a holistic scheduling model for the construction professionals. This study is expected to provide an alternative planning strategy and assist project managers in selecting optimal TCQS trade-offs while constructing a facility.","[Panwar, Abhilasha; Jha, Kumar Neeraj] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, Delhi 110016, India","Panwar, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, Delhi 110016, India.",apanwar38@gmail.com; knjha@civil.iitd.ac.in,,,,,,63,2,2,5,5,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The performance of construction projects will be adversely affected if the relationships between main contractors and subcontractors are not properly managed. Therefore, the relationships between main contractors and subcontractors are becoming more and more important to the success of construction projects. Based on a comprehensive questionnaire survey in the Hong Kong construction industry, the relationship between main contractors and subcontractors was studied. Main contractors in the local industry can be classified into four clusters according to the nature of their relationship with subcontractors, namely, adversarial, coopetitive, collaborative, and partnering. Furthermore, the impact of these relationships on main contractor competitiveness and the critical factors affecting collaborative/partnering relationships and main contractor competitiveness were also explored. The findings of this research reveal that good relationships with subcontractors are positively and advantageously associated with main contractor competitiveness. A long-term partnering relationship, based on win-win principles, is more likely to benefit both parties in construction practice.

The results reveal that the networks become dense over time and exhibit distinct scale-free properties. Furthermore, these macrolevel characteristics of network dynamics significantly relate to the structure-based preferential attachment effect, the ownership similarity effect, the geographic proximity effect, the negative scale similarity effect, and the ownership-based individual covariate effect, which operates at a microlevel. The findings not only provide a network view of how construction organizations select subcontractors in projects, but also contribute to broadened understanding of how project-based collaborative networks among firms in the construction industry evolve as complex adaptive systems whose macrolevel dynamics closely relate to a set of micro-organizing mechanisms.","[Tang, Yixuan; Wang, Guangbin; Cao, Dongping] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Li, Heng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, 11 Yuk Choi Rd, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Cao, DP (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",tangyixuan@tongji.edu.cn; gb_wang@tongji.edu.cn; heng.li@polyu.edu.hk; dongping.cao@tongji.edu.cn,"Li, Heng/B-2821-2015","Li, Heng/0000-0002-3187-9041; Cao, Dongping/0000-0002-6366-2621",Public Policy Research Funding Scheme in Hong Kong [2016.A6.075.17A]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71771172]; Program for Young Excellent Talents in Tongji University [22120180008]; Shanghai Pujiang Talent Program,"This research has been financially supported by the Public Policy Research Funding Scheme in Hong Kong (Grant No. 2016.A6.075.17A), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71771172), the Program for Young Excellent Talents in Tongji University (Grant No. 22120180008), and the Shanghai Pujiang Talent Program.

Limited studies have calculated the cost savings of hiring private contractors; however, most of them have not calculated cost savings based on life-cycle costs (LCCs). The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the LCC of chip seal and stripping maintenance activities performed by in-house workers are cheaper than those performed by private contractors. Design/methodology/approach The paper collected the hard cost data of chip seal and stripping maintenance activities performed by state DOT in-house workers, as well as private contractors, from 2003 to 2016 from the Nevada DOT Maintenance and Asset Management division. Statistical tests were conducted to test the research hypothesis that the LCC of chip seal and stripping activities performed by in-house workers are significantly less than those performed by private contractors. Findings The study results showed that the cost per unit and LCC of chip seal and striping work performed by in-house workers were significantly less than those performed by private contractors in Nevada. Research limitations/implications - The study only collected data from Nevada DOT, so readers should use caution in generalizing the findings of this study. Additionally, factors affecting the cost of these maintenance activities for private contractors are significantly different compared to in-house contractors. Therefore, these differences may be some of the potential reasons for cost difference between these two methods. Practical implications - The practical implications of this study are that state DOT engineers need to plan for outsourcing chip seal and stripping maintenance activities only to private contractors that are cost effective, based on life-cycle cost. Originality/value The LCC analysis framework developed in this study will help state DOT engineers to determine cost savings by using in-house workers for road maintenance works.","[Shrestha, Kishor] Montana Technol Univ, Civil Engn Dept, Sch Mines & Engn, Butte, MT USA; [Shrestha, Pramen P.] Univ Nevada, Civil & Environm Engn & Construct, Coll Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Lidder, Mylinh] Nevada Dept Transportat, Maintenance & Asset Management Div, Carson City, NV USA","Shrestha, PP (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Civil & Environm Engn & Construct, Coll Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",pramen.shrestha@unlv.edu,,"Shrestha, Pramen/0000-0001-6362-2315",,,,23,1,1,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

However, much of the research carried out in the United Kingdom (UK) on construction-tendering has been done from the perspective of the relationship between the contractor and client. This paper addresses that gap by identifying and examining the major barriers to effective pricing of tenders by subcontractors and the business environment of their commercial relationships with contractors. A questionnaire study involving 94 subcontractors and semistructured interviews with five of them was conducted in 2011. The primary barriers to providing better cost-certainty and quality of response in quotations to contractors relate to quality of documents, bidding time, competition, resource levels, information and communication technology, unethical behavior by the contractor, uneven collaborative relationships, input specificity, level of relationship that exists, and the time to assimilate and provide the output response. Contractors and clients should help address the barriers. For contractors, this can enhance competitiveness, profitability, and supply-chain relationships. For clients, this can lead to better project outcomes because subcontractors form a major part of the organizational structure of projects. Addressing the concerns expressed by subcontractors may also require a collaborative approach, perhaps in conjunction with an industry-wide investigation and plan of action.","[Laryea, Samuel] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Construct Econ & Management, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Lubbock, Alex] Carillion PLC, Property & Facil Off, Oxford OX4 2WD, England","Laryea, S (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Construct Econ & Management, POB 20, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",Samuel.Laryea@wits.ac.za,,"Laryea, Samuel/0000-0001-6605-208X",,,,49,5,5,2,27,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

However, these approaches have been found to be associated with negative potential impact on the health and safety of field personnel. Prevention through Design (PtD) strategies are well-suited to prevent potential construction hazards in green jobs. The aim of this study is to examine the perception of construction industry professionals about incorporating PtD practices into sustainable design and construction. To gauge the perception of professionals, a survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to two construction industry groups (designers and constructors). The present study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing evidence of the level of viability and extent of implementation of PtD practices into sustainable design and construction as well as identifying prevailing barriers and potential enablers of PtD implementation in the AEC industry. The findings of this research indicate that a majority of construction industry professionals, especially designers, are resistant to the implementation of PtD practices into sustainable projects at this point in time. Fear of liability, contractual methods, and lack of safety knowledge were found to be the most prevailing barriers to the acceptance of PtD practices within the AEC industry. By contrast, ethics was regarded as the primary potential enabler for the implementation of PtD practice within the AEC industry. The authors recommend that the AEC industry move further toward collaborative project delivery methods. This transformation can facilitate a wider implementation of PtD practices within the AEC industry, especially in sustainable design and construction.

For understanding worker movements in dynamic construction environments which involve moving and changing objects, a system named 'WoTAS' (Worker Trajectory Analysis System) is proposed. First, a real-time Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons-based data collection and trajectory pre-processing subsystem is built for extracting multifaceted trajectory characteristics and stay regions of the workers that will help in recognizing the important regions in the building for categorizing the worker movements. Second, to enable the desired semantic insights for better understanding the underlying meaningful worker movements using the contextual data repositories related to the building environment, an ontology-based 'STriDE' (Semantic Trajectories for Dynamic Environments) model is applied which tracks the evolution of moving and changing building objects and outputs semantic trajectories. For extracting insights from the semantic trajectories, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used which is one of the probabilistic approaches present in the literature for describing the object behavior in time. Using the HMMs, a set of trajectories belonging to a stay region is analyzed by categorizing the worker movements into four different states. In the end, the output of the Viterbi algorithm is visualized using a BIM model for identifying the most probable high-risk locations involving sharp worker movements and rotations. The developed 'WoTAS' system will help safety managers in monitoring and controlling building activities remotely in dynamic environments by understanding the worker movements for improved safety management in day-to-day building operations. Eventually, understanding the worker movements will contribute towards reducing the chances of near-miss incidents on sites which have the potential to cause serious accidents.","[Arslan, Muhammad; Cruz, Christophe] Univ Bourgogne Franche, LIB, EA 7534, Comte, France; [Ginhac, Dominique] Univ Bourgogne Franche, Lab Imagerie & Vis Artificielle, EA 7535, Comte, France","Arslan, M (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche, LIB, EA 7534, Comte, France.",muhammad.arslan@u-bourgogne.fr; christophe.cruz@ubfc.fr; dominique.ginhac@ubfc.fr,"CRUZ, Christophe/I-2419-2012; Ginhac, Dominique/C-5088-2008; Arslan, Muhammad/T-6589-2018","CRUZ, Christophe/0000-0002-5611-9479; Ginhac, Dominique/0000-0002-5911-2010; Arslan, Muhammad/0000-0003-3682-7002","Conseil Regional de Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, the French government","The authors thank the Conseil Regional de Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, the French government for their funding, SATT Grand-Est, and IUT-Dijon (http://iutdijon.u-bourgogne.fr) for allowing us to conduct a real-time case study in their laboratory.

The purpose of this study is to empirically test the effects of two stakeholder attributes - contractor-perceived contractor salience and contractor project position - on the criticality of five typical contractor-related risks: risk of (1) injuries and accidents, (2) quality defects, (3) work delays, (4) cost overruns and (5) breaches of contract. Design/methodology/approach Questionnaire data were collected from 118 Chinese contractor managers. Regression models were run in Mplus 7.11 to test the hypotheses. Findings The data show that higher contractor-perceived contractor salience and a more supportive contractor project position were both related to lower criticality of contractor-related risks, including risk of (1) injuries and accidents, (2) quality defects, (3) work delays, (4) cost overruns and (5) breaches of contract. Contractor salience also mediated the negative relationship between a supportive contractor project position and the criticality of contractor-related risks. Research limitations/implications The authors' research design is cross-sectional and thus cannot establish causation in the relationships among the studied variables. The single item measure of contractor project position was used for the first time in the present study; thus, its reliability and validity still await more empirical examinations. Originality/value The findings advance the understanding of the value of stakeholder management in projects by specifying that prioritizing stakeholders' claims and securing their support for the project reduce the criticality of stakeholder-related risks. By providing empirical evidence from the construction context, the findings also add to knowledge on the instrumental power of stakeholder management in enhancing project risk management performance.","[Xia, Nini; Guo, Jiale; Lin, Yi-Hsin] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Lin, YH (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",yihsinlin@seu.edu.cn,,"Lin, Yi-Hsin/0000-0002-8119-4921","Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of the Ministry of Education of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [20YJCZH183]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [72002030, 71772136]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20200383]","This work was supported by the Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of the Ministry of Education of China (project number 20YJCZH183), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (project numbers 72002030 and 71772136), and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (project number BK20200383).

Forty-eight responses were analyzed for scores on 38 categories of contractor information in terms of value to client, contractor costs, client costs, and value for money. The client and contractor responses for value to client and client costs of processing were found to be homogeneous. Those for contractor costs and value for money differed significantly between the clients and the contractors. A simple linear regression analysis was used to model the responses, and an index of cost-benefit was derived for each of the categories. This was found to be superior to all of the nonlinear alternatives examined. The model was also found to have greater intuitive value than the equivalent raw value for money responses.","Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Construct Management & Property, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Ng, ST (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,"Skitmore, Martin/I-9743-2012; Ng, S.

However, in spite of the risks involved, the history of the construction industry is full of projects that were completed with significant cost overruns. Contractors used to be able to cover their cost overburdens with their markups. However, with diminishing markups, even marginal cost overburdens can easily wipe out their profits and even lead to a financial overburden. Therefore, contractors need to identify major risk sources causing cost overburdens in advance to be proactive in managing them. This paper reviews and describes uncontrollable risk sources that affect the contractor's risk of cost overburden. Sources of these risks relate to factors affecting the cost estimate and the final cost of a project and include factors specific to the cost estimator, the project design, construction, and the project environment. The paper describes each of these factors in detail and gives specific examples based on a survey of the relevant literature.","Stanford Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Construct Engn & Management Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Akinci, B (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Construct Engn & Management Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,37,67,67,0,18,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",0742-597X,,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

A postal and email surveys were undertaken on Malaysian building companies, focusing on the benefits and difficulties associated with the implementation of quality cost system. Statistical analyses based on Chi-Squared test and Relative Importance Index techniques were used to investigate the significance of the findings and determine the relative importance of the factors. The most important benefit of measuring quality costs is getting management attention and increase quality awareness as perceived by the sample of the study. The possible barriers that may affect the management's decision to implement quality cost system are identified and grouped into three categories, which are culture and knowledge; system; and company. The study suggests that the level of the site staff's knowledge should be as important as that of the management to successfully collect and record quality costs data. The findings of this research will raise the level of awareness and sensitize managers and those involved with building industry about the importance of quality cost system and collecting quality costs data.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate various factors (time, cost, technical know-how, organizational, sustainability, etc.) and their influence on the choice of the construction method. The paper examines the different assessments of designers, manufacturers, and contractors regarding precast construction in comparison to traditional in-situ methods, and highlights the major differences in their views. Design/methodology/approach - Structured face-to-face surveys were conducted with top management personnel of precast manufacturers, architectural and engineering firms, and contracting companies in Lebanon. In addition, a case study from the largest precast project in Lebanon was used to provide a deeper understanding of factors encouraging the use of precast concrete, and to highlight major onsite issues associated with its implementation. Findings - On the one hand, the findings highlight technical, logistical, organizational, and cultural factors that inhibit the use of precast concrete as a construction method. On the other hand, results reveal that cost, time, sustainability, and flexibility factors are the main enablers for increasing the uptake of modular concrete construction. Originality/value - The main contribution to knowledge is that this study presents different stakeholders' perspectives on precast concrete construction. Moreover, this is the first research addressing precast concrete construction in the Middle East and Lebanon. The results of the study provide valuable global insights and recommendations that may help increase the uptake of precast concrete construction. They can also guide project stakeholders to properly match project characteristics and precast concrete as a construction method.","[Hamzeh, Farook; Ghani, Omar Abdul; Bacha, Mohammad Bassel Saleh; Abbas, Yara] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Beirut, Lebanon","Hamzeh, F (corresponding author), Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Beirut, Lebanon.",fh35@aub.edu.lb,"Hamzeh, Farook R/N-7980-2014","Hamzeh, Farook R/0000-0002-3986-9534",FEA start-up at the American University of Beirut,"The authors are indebted to the help of all the industry professionals who have participated in this research.

Design media are intended to support the cognitive nature of design and, particularly, the exploitation of design knowledge in computational environments. Basic theoretical assumptions are presented which underlie the development of design media. A central assumption is that designers share common forms of design knowledge which can be formalized, represented, and employed in computational environments. Generic knowledge is proposed as one such seminal form of design knowledge. We then develop a cognitive model which relates to the internal mental representations, strategies and mechanisms of generic design. The paper emphasizes the theoretical foundations of design media. This theoretical discussion is then exemplified through case studies presenting current research for the support of visual cognition in design. We introduce an approach to design schema as a visual form of generic design knowledge. Secondly we present a conceptual framework for the support of schema emergence in visual reasoning in design media. Finally, some implications of schema emergence in design collaboration are presented and discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The model uses a modified quality function deployment model to support the quality performance measurement that is involved in multiattribute and multiparticipant decision-making and the Delphi method to deal efficiently with the uncertainties in the input data. State DOTs that are in the process of selecting a pavement contractor for a project would benefit from the CQP evaluation model because the system allows a client to expeditiously assess the quality performance of potential pavement contractors in their bidding list. A test case is presented to illustrate the functioning of the model. The model contributes to improve the quality of the nation's pavements because it enhances the contract administration procedures by reengineering the current contractor assessment, prequalification, and/or selection process within the owner organizations (state departments of transportation) by accentuating total client (both the road users' and the owners') satisfaction.

This research investigates the implementation of ECI in Local Government projects in Sydney, Australia. Interviews revealed that the main challenges are probity, developing principle project requirements document, running ECI workshops, changing the attitudes of project participants, and the time-consuming nature of ECI process. When these challenges are overcome, Local Government projects can reap the benefits of ECI, such as collaborative work relationships, better constructability, innovation, cost certainty, improved risk management, and better value for money.

To improve the quality of engineering consulting firms, various quality techniques and practices have been proposed by researchers. Most researchers agree that the successful implementation of such quality practices depends on the quality culture of the consultant organization. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the overall quality culture that exists in a consultant organization is essential. The purpose of this paper is to develop a pragmatic tool, a quality culture auditing (QCA) questionnaire, which enables engineering consulting firms to measure the quality culture quantitatively through a scoring system. The responses obtained from 30 engineering consulting firms that participated in the QCA show that the scores obtained can be a good indicator of a consultant organization's current quality culture. Using these results as the basis, benchmarking exercises and parametric studies can also be conducted. Through the use of QCA, an engineering consultant can pinpoint areas of weakness so that more effort can be put into these areas for future improvement.","[Aoieong, Raymond T.

This study presents the development of a computerized platform for evaluating contractor safety performance that is capable of analyzing contractors' safety performance data. The platform incorporates newly developed parameters that enable (1) including leading and lagging safety indicators that depict current and past contractor safety performance; (2) conducting analysis on both the organizational and project levels; and (3) satisfying the requirements of international safety standards. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by presenting a validated standard-compliant set of 10 indicators and 71 metrics that facilitate evaluating contractor safety performance and establishing their significance analytically.

Research on cost performance has mostly focused on one of the involved parties, either the client or the contractor. Not many research efforts discuss the cost contingency performance of projects. This research discusses the cost performance and cost contingency of projects in the execution phase from the perspective of a client as well as a contractor. Using a case study approach, 95 projects are investigated: 44 client projects and 51 contractor projects. The results show that depending on the perspective, projects can have cost overruns or cost underruns. Comparing the total realized and estimated costs, projects experienced on average about 16% underrun from a client perspective. From a contractor perspective, projects experienced on average up to 2% overrun. The estimated cost contingency in the client's projects was on average 2.64% more than the required cost contingency. The estimated cost contingency in the contractor's projects was on average 5.41% less than the required cost contingency. These differences are explained by pessimism bias and technical reasons on the client's side. On the contractor side, optimism bias and technical and political reasons play a role, resulting in opportunistic behavior. The findings help practitioners to enhance their cost estimates by avoiding both pessimistic bias and optimism bias behavior-for example, by using historical data from earlier projects. Further investigation into the influence of market conditions on cost estimates is suggested.","[Hoseini, Erfan] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Infrastruct Design & Management, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [van Veen, Pim] Dura Vermeer Infra, Taurusave 100, NL-2132 LS Hoofddorp, Netherlands; [Bosch-Rekveldt, Marian] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Infrastruct Design & Management, Project Management, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Hertogh, Marcel] Delft Univ Technol, Res Grp Infrastruct Design & Management, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands","Hoseini, E (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Infrastruct Design & Management, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",e.hoseini@tudelft.nl; p.v.veen@duravermeer.nl; M.G.C.Bosch-Rekveldt@tudelft.nl; M.J.C.M.Hertogh@tudelft.nl,,"Bosch-Rekveldt, Marian/0000-0001-9309-6352",,,,62,5,5,8,32,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Suitable platforms for enhancing an as-built schedule visually during the construction phase are necessary and important for general contractors. As the application of building information modeling (BIM) becomes more common, schedule management integrated with the BIM approach becomes essential to enhance visual construction management implementation for the general contractor during the construction phase. To enhance visualization of the updated as-built schedule for the general contractor, this study presents a novel system called the Construction BIM-assisted Schedule Management (ConBIM-SM) system for general contractors in Taiwan. The primary purpose of this study is to develop a web ConBIM-SM system for the general contractor to enhance visual as-built schedule information sharing and efficiency in tracking construction as-built schedule. Finally, the ConBIM-SM system is applied to a case study of a commerce building project in Taiwan to verify its efficacy and demonstrate its effectiveness during the construction phase. The advantages of the ConBIM-SM system lie in improved project control and management efficiency for general contractors, and in providing BIM-assisted as-built schedule tracking and management, to access the most current as-built schedule information through a web browser. The case study results show that the ConBIM-SM system is an effective visual as-built schedule management platform integrated with the BIM approach for general contractors in a construction project.","[Tserng, Hui-Ping; Ho, Shih-Ping; Jan, Shu-Hui] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 10764, Taiwan","Jan, SH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1 Roosevelt Rd,Sec 4, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",d94521007@ntu.edu.tw,", Ping/AAK-8656-2021",,,,,51,13,14,7,114,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

However, it has not been well recognized that variations in safety performance could exist in the same contractor's regional offices. There is also a lack of understanding of the differences between regions and what causes these variations. This paper analyzes the safety performance of a general contractor's six major regional branches across four states after implementation of a new safety management program. The research finds apparent differences in regional incident rates (IRs) and safety violation rates (SVRs), although the shared perceptions from workers and site management personnel about how the safety program is implemented (i.e., safety climate and culture) are generally consistent companywide. This research also discloses that regional IRs, SVRs, safety climate, and culture are uncorrelated in the long term (during the 17-month study period), but have some linear relationships over a short duration (during the 4-month survey period). The correlation analysis in this study does not find a significant influence of workers' demographic characteristics and a few other potential influencing factors on regional safety performance. These findings will provide useful insights to industry practitioners who aim to achieve good, consistent safety management and performance across regions.

Using sequential data collection approach through focused group discussions, questionnaire and an in-depth semi-structured interview, 26 effects of construction projects abandonment on stakeholders are identified. The top 10 most important effects are: unemployment, bad image for the government, government sector underdevelopment, slow economic growth, financial institutions lose confidence in the state, discourages investment, loss of revenue by state, pollution, loss of properties and loss of revenue by the citizens. The effects were grouped into four main themes and the most important effects are the economic, social, political and psychological respectively.

While the SQE program proved to be effective, the alliance also recognized that rework had become an issue and thus developed a rework prevention program as part of their continuous improvement process. Thus, this paper describes the nature of these programs and provides statistical analysis to demonstrate their combined effectiveness in reducing safety incidents.

Pipe and steel fabricators' inputs at different design stages of industrial construction projects are identified. The case study shows that these inputs lead to improved drawing quality, material supply, information flow, and consequently improved construction schedule performance. This impact on construction schedule is illustrated using actual project data and simulation techniques. Simulation models were developed to demonstrate intuitively the impact at the construction operation level and they allow people to gain management insights through simulation experiments.

The burden of capital costs on contractors is heavy and financial alternatives for the reduction of capital costs are always desired. The objective of this study is to derive a mathematical way of defining the contractor's costs for factoring account receivables, which is a form of commercial finance whereby a business sells its account receivables at a discount. Factoring can be thus considered as a contractor selling his/her accounts receivable to a factor, a financial institution that provides the services of financing, credit management, and collection. Nevertheless, factoring has far not been used for construction project financing. The relevant literature, empirical practices, and factoring theories from outside the construction industry are all evaluated and the features needed to derive the cost function are explored and integrated. This includes commission costs, expected debt costs, and credit monitoring costs. The case study is utilized and discussed to illustrate the use of factoring for a construction project and its related costs. Under the given assumptions that represent the most common financial conditions in Taiwan, the simulation results show that the contractor's factoring costs without recourse for the construction project make up only 0.8% of the total costs of the examined project which is relatively lower than that of most traditional financing. In addition, the application of factoring has the advantage of facilitating financial management, instantly improving cash flow, enhancement of investment efficiency, avoiding extra loan procedures, improving credit rating, and transfer of financial risk. Factoring is indeed a feasible financial tool for construction projects.","[Chen, Jieh-Haur; Chen, Wei-Hsiang] Natl Cent Univ, Inst Construct Engn & Management, Tao Yuan 32001, Taiwan","Chen, JH (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Inst Construct Engn & Management, Tao Yuan 32001, Taiwan.",jhchen@ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,34,4,4,2,39,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the factors that project managers experience as having the greatest effect on time, cost, and quality, and to discover whether the effects of these factors are significantly different from each other. A questionnaire with 26 factors identified from interviews was sent to the full population of publicly employed project managers. Factors were ranked using the relative importance index and tested for significant differences using Friedman's test. Wilcoxon's test was used in a post-hoc analysis. From the findings it was determined that the most influential factor for time is unsettled or lack of project funding; for cost, errors or omissions in consultant material; and for quality, errors or omissions in construction work. The main conclusion of this research is that project schedule, budget, and quality level are affected in significantly different ways. Therefore, a project manager cannot handle such critical issues by focusing only on schedule or budget complications; nor can he or she assume that time, cost, and quality are equally affected.

Several studies indicate that the DB project delivery system has advantages in project cost and schedule performance. Despite having comparative advantages, DB projects are found to be far from immune from cost overruns and schedule delay in those studies. It is critical to understand the effects of various factors underpinning the cost and schedule performance of DB projects. The overall objective of this research is to utilize cluster analysis and statistical analysis to identify factors with significant potentials to describe the variability of project cost and schedule performance in DB environment. Several control factors, such as evolving requirements from owners, unforeseen conditions, attributes of project teams, and major project characteristics were taken into account. This research contributes to the body of knowledge in innovative project delivery through empirical examination of underlying factors affecting project cost and schedule performance. The notable findings are (1) progressive DB is associated with the best cost performance, and its application could effectively reduce owner-directed changes; (2) project managers' experience, particularly the lack thereof, brings more variability to cost performance, while projects in the places with greater experience with completed projects show greater cost performance; (3) the effects of contract and procurement method on cost performance are significantly moderated by project and owner types; (4) unforeseen conditions are not necessarily related to cost performance; and (5) some unforeseen conditions (i.e., unforeseen inclement weather and unforeseen interruptions from government) are found to have statistically significant negative implications on schedule performance.","[Liang Yunping] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ashuri, Baabak] Georgia Inst Technol, Econ Sustainable Built Environm Lab, Sch Bldg Construct, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ashuri, Baabak] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Sun Wei] Tongji Univ, Coll Civil Engn, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Ashuri, B (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Econ Sustainable Built Environm Lab, Sch Bldg Construct, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.; Ashuri, B (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",yunping.liang@gatech.edu; baabak@gatech.edu; 1550878@tongji.edu.cn,,"Ashuri, Baabak/0000-0002-4320-1035",,,,35,2,2,4,21,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

While a significant research have been published on this topic, the understanding of the root causes and a clear direction towards improvement remained unexplored. The focus of the past research is mainly on the factors directly or indirectly associated with the project environment and their relative impacts on overall cost performance in projects. In contrast to such traditional approach, this research aimed to establish a conceptual model by identifying the underlying issues associated mainly with the perceptions of the board stakeholders involved over entire lifecycle of projects. Based on a structured interview with a few selective organisations, data was collected and a few rich pictures were developed over every phase of project development. By employing the soft system methodology, the rich pictures were later trasformed into the concept models for potential establishment of a new body of knowledge in the field. Among the findings, it has been revealed that at the project inception stage, political and legislative factors play significant roles in the business case development. Statutory compliance and environmental issues are perceived to be critical in influencing cost performance in projects. The resulting concept model on cost overrun is expected to fill a significant knowledge gap in cost estimation practice across all industry sectors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA.

Since the launch of going out' national strategy in the new century, and with the support and control of the government and subordinate agencies, associations and banks, and innovative approach such as Angola Mode, Chinese contractors' presence in the emerging African market continues to grow. Based on original empirical data collected through interview and questionnaire surveys, this paper analyzes the mechanisms the Chinese government has established to facilitate Chinese contractors' entry into Africa and the perspectives of Chinese contractors about the African market in terms of opportunities and threats. Regression analysis based on existing datasets indicates that despite perceived opportunities and threats, Chinese contractors' performance in Africa in terms of business revenue actually hinges upon the availability of construction capital. The study also reviews the market entry modes used by Chinese contractors, concluding that they prefer to establish a long term presence and opt to commit large resources. Overall, the paper summarizes evidence about the status and innovative approaches of Chinese contractors in penetrating the African construction market, and also characterizes the potential of the African construction market for Chinese contractors.","[Chen, Chuan] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Orr, Ryan J.] Stanford Univ, Collaboratory Res Global Projects, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Chen, C (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",chuanc@unimelb.edu.au; rjorr@stanford.edu,,,PPIAF,`The writers are grateful to the assistance from Pi-Chu Chiu in coding the survey data and to PPIAF for providing funding for the study through a subcontract from Vivien Foster.,,17,56,59,2,30,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

It is the most widely used industry performance indicator because a small number of representative items covers a wide range of costs. The construction industry consists of various facility types that can be organized into many subcontractors' works. Unfortunately, the existing cost indexes have difficulty monitoring the fluctuation of the subcontractors' costs since they select representative items in macro-scale terms, such as the type of construction or facility. Therefore, this study was conducted to develop a selection model that can select the effective representative items included in the subcontractors' costs. To determine the characteristics of the subcontractors' costs, the curve estimation function of SPSS (R) 12.0 for Windows was applied to the priced bills of quantities of 30 multi-family housing projects. The results of the analysis show that the relationship between the coverage ratio and the percentage of the number of representative items follows Pareto's principle. Based on this, a selection model of representative items was developed, using the tangent function. The case study that was conducted to verify the usability of the model revealed that the proposed model can efficiently select the effective representative items from the cost items of each subcontractor's work included in multi-family housing projects.","[Hong, TaeHoon] Yonsei Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Park, Sung-Chul] Korean Educ Dev Inst, Educ Facil Res & Management Ctr, Seoul, South Korea; [Koo, Kyo-Jin; Hyun, Chang-Taek] Univ Seoul, Dept Architectural Engn, Seoul, South Korea","Hong, T (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",pcs9530@kedi.re.kr; hong7@yonsei.ac.kr; kook@uos.ac.kr; cthyun@uos.ac.kr,"Hong, Taehoon/E-9169-2012","Hong, Taehoon/0000-0001-5136-8276","Ministry of Land, Transportation and Maritime Affairs of Korea government [05CIT-D05-01]","This research was supported by a grant (05CIT-D05-01) from Construction Technology Innovation Program funded by Ministry of Land, Transportation and Maritime Affairs of Korea government.",,21,3,3,0,8,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

A qualification model that includes the quality of a contractor's past work would be invaluable in assuring that each project had a quality contractor. Including the quality of past work in the bidding process would further help in this goal. Implementation of such a model for both its potential uses would require business process reengineering for the DOT in two important areas: qualification of contractors and contract award procedures. The research team has produced an innovative model, called the Quality-Based Performance Rating (QBPR) system. This model receives inputs from traditional subjective sources and integrates them with totally objective data input from the results of tests of the project's materials and workmanship, then uses these inputs to produce a score for each project that is further used by the system to generate an index for each contractor reflecting that contractor's quality of work over a specified time frame.","[Minchin, R.

Unstructured interviews were undertaken with volunteer construction workers from two areas: those returning from international development projects and those regularly volunteering on UK heritage railways. Taking a social constructionist perspective, data was explored using discourse analysis to illuminate 'safety' within this unique construction 'industry'. Those with engineering or technical backgrounds developed more tangible constructions of safety, around risks and hazards, within their activities, yet volunteers without this experience also acknowledged a wider context of danger. Volunteers on overseas projects developed discourses of 'difference' between safety at home and safety outside the UK, associated with negative practices overseas yet with acceptance of their inevitability as part of the voluntary experience.

It requires cost engineers equipped with a wide knowledge of construction and a professional ability to make judgments. However, stress will deaden their use of knowledge and influence their professional judgment in estimating. In the construction industry, cost engineers can generally be divided into two main groups: clients' cost engineers in consultant firms or in a development company who serve clients; and contractors' cost engineers in construction companies working for the contractors. This study investigates the causal relationships between the stressors and stress of clients' and contractors' cost engineers. Two stressor-stress integrated models were developed for these two cost engineer groups by using the structural equation model. The findings revealed some stressors that affected both clients' and contractors' cost engineers: (1) poor environment, role conflict and work underload affect their stress positively; (2) social support and Type A behavior affect their stress negatively; and (3) work underload induces stress via the role conflict among cost engineers, their supervisors, and the organization. On the other hand, some deviations between these two groups of cost engineers also occur: (1) social support acts as a source of stressors of clients' cost engineers; (2) a private life stressor only affects the stress of contractors' cost engineers; and (3) a closed interactive looping relationship among role conflict, Type A behavior, and work underload affects contractors' cost engineers. Based on the results of this study, some recommendations are suggested to manage cost engineers' stress well.","[Leung, Mei-yung; Chan, Yee-shan; Sham, Janet Fung-Chu] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Bldg & Construct, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chong, Alice] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Appl Social Studies, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Leung, MY (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Bldg & Construct, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bcmei@cityu.edu.hk,"Leung, Mei-yung/K-4075-2015; Chong, Alice M.L./K-7412-2019; Chong, Alice/P-4008-2015","Leung, Mei-yung/0000-0003-4186-2347; Chong, Alice M.L./0000-0002-5727-1325; Chong, Alice/0000-0002-5727-1325; Sham, Janet Fung Chu/0000-0001-6424-5734",,,,50,22,22,1,14,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The research presented two key factors determining how the contractors analyzed manage time and cost contingencies: project objectives and existing mistrust among the contractor's team members. The research also found that managers use time and cost contingencies not only to manage threats, but also as tools for managing opportunities, thereby providing insight into a previously undescribed form of contingency: the negative contingency. the research results enable a better understanding of the actual behavior of general contractors, which contributes to paving the way for developing enhanced methods for contingencies management.","[Ortiz, Jose, I] Univ Carlos III, Area Ind Engn, Av Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain; [Pellicer, Eugenio] Univ Politecn Valencia, Sch Civil Engn, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Molenaar, Keith R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, UCB 428, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Pellicer, E (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Sch Civil Engn, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",pellicer@upv.es,"Pellicer, Eugenio/B-5593-2012","Pellicer, Eugenio/0000-0001-9100-0644",,,,47,6,6,0,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

Both mailed and personally administered survey methods with structured questionnaires were used to collect the data. Using a partial least squared - structural equation modelling for the data analysis, we found a significant positive relationship between the adhocracy culture and sustainable construction. Similarly, the results also indicated that market orientation had a significant positive relationship with sustainable construction. The study also found a significant but negative relationship between government support and sustainable construction. As expected, government support was found to moderate the relationship between adhocracy culture and sustainable construction, while an insignificant interaction effect was found between market orientation and sustainable construction.

To overcome this problem, clients in the construction industry sometimes use schedule incentive/disincentive (I/D) contracting strategy. However, previous studies have shown that inadequate understanding and wrong implementation of schedule I/D provisions could result in unintended results. Moreover, the use of the I/D contracting method is in its initial stages in many countries such as India. The purpose of this paper is to identify various factors that are essential for schedule I/D success in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted among experienced professionals (clients, contractors and consultants) from across the Indian construction industry. Findings Top success factors related to clients in the descending order of their importance are: realistic targets; detailed guidelines for I/D implementation; close coordination with other stakeholders; correct estimation of I/D duration and amount; and imposing disincentives after due consideration. Meanwhile, factors related to contractor organisations are: continuous monitoring and control; thorough understanding of schedule I/D targets; specific considerations in appointing senior project personnel; effective communication; and proper labour management. Originality/value This research highlights the specific roles of both clients and contractors in the success of schedule I/D projects in developing countries such as India.","[Hasan, Abid] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Jha, Kumar Neeraj] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi, India","Hasan, A (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",abid.hasan@mymail.unisa.edu.au,"hasan, abid/F-6224-2016","hasan, abid/0000-0003-2031-4288",,,,91,6,7,5,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a parallel Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method for evaluation of project activities with different execution modes to select the best execution mode and find a trade-off between objectives. Also, according to the nature of the project activities, outputs are categorized into desirable (quality) and undesirable (time, cost and environmental impacts) and analyzed based on the DEA model. In order to rank efficient execution modes, the ideal and anti-ideal virtual units method is used. The proposed model is implemented on a real case of a rural water supply construction project to demonstrate its validity. Findings The findings show that the use of the efficient execution mode in each activity leads to an optimal trade-off between the four project objectives (time, cost, quality and environmental impacts). Practical implications This study help project managers and practitioners with choosing the most efficient execution modes of project activities taking time-cost-quality-environmental impacts into account. Originality/value In this paper, in addition to time and cost optimization of construction projects, quality factors and environmental impacts are considered. Further to the authors' knowledge, there is no method for evaluating project activities' efficiency. The efficiency of different activity modes is also evaluated for the first time to select the most efficient modes. This research can assist project managers with choosing the most appropriate execution modes for the activities to ultimately accomplish the project with the lowest time, cost and environmental impacts along with the highest quality.","[Banihashemi, Sayyid Ali] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Birjand, Iran; [Khalilzadeh, Mohammad] CENTRUM Catolica Grad Business Sch, Lima, Peru; [Khalilzadeh, Mohammad] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Lima, Peru","Khalilzadeh, M (corresponding author), CENTRUM Catolica Grad Business Sch, Lima, Peru.; Khalilzadeh, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Lima, Peru.",banihashemi@pnu.ac.ir; mo.kzadeh@gmail.com,"Banihashemi, Sayyid Ali/M-8445-2017","Banihashemi, Sayyid Ali/0000-0003-4676-2847; KHALILZADEH, MOHAMMAD/0000-0002-2373-8505",,,,54,5,5,10,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Given the importance of workplace safety, awarding the contract to safer contractors can enhance project performance outcomes in terms of safety, quality, cost, and schedule. Safety maturity is one quality of a construction organization encompassing interdependent factors that can be used to evaluate expected safety performance. However, there is no formal decision-making framework available in literature that owners can use to evaluate contractor safety maturity. The present study aims to bridge this gap in safety knowledge by proposing a decision-making framework that can be used to evaluate the safety maturity of construction contractors. Development of the decision-making framework included two tasks. First, an integrative literature review to identify influential safety maturity factors and their potential indicators was performed. The result of the review revealed seven factors (safety leading indicators, safety lagging indicators, safety and supervisory personnel, system maturity and resiliency, preconstruction services, technology and innovation, and safety culture) that influence the safety maturity of construction contractors. Second, the identified factors, and their indicators, were integrated into a formal multicriteria decision-making method, referred to as Choosing by Advantages, to evaluate the safety maturity of five construction contractors on a selected case study project. The proposed framework is expected to provide practical and theoretical directions on how to evaluate contractor safety maturity using relevant evaluation factors and sound decision-making methods.","[Karakhan, Ali A.] Univ Baghdad, Engn Affairs Dept, Baghdad 10071, Iraq; [Karakhan, Ali A.; Gambatese, John; Nnaji, Chukwuma] Oregon State Univ, Sch Civil & Construct Engn, 101 Kearney Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Rajendran, Sathyanarayanan] Cent Washington Univ, Engn Technol Safety & Construct Dept, Ellensburg, WA 98926 USA","Karakhan, AA (corresponding author), Univ Baghdad, Engn Affairs Dept, Baghdad 10071, Iraq.; Karakhan, AA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Sch Civil & Construct Engn, 101 Kearney Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",karakhan@uobaghdad.edu.iq; sathyanarayanan.rajendran@cwu.edu; john.gambatese@oregonstate.edu; nnajic@oregonstate.edu,"Karakhan, Ali Amer/ABE-8949-2020","Karakhan, Ali Amer/0000-0003-0088-8487",,,,109,25,25,1,57,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The factors affecting motivation, goal-setting, workforce needs, and incentives were investigated to determine the attributes for a subcontractor employee motivational model. A survey addressing these four categories was distributed to subcontractor foremen and supervisors to establish a list of motivational factors. The statistical analysis of the survey results aided in the final development of the proposed subcontractor based employee motivational model, which includes such components as confidence and competence as being reinforced by quality of work, incentives, safe performance, praise, and a sense of belonging. The proposed model provides industry practitioners with another level of understanding of the motivation sequence of the subcontractor's labor force. Perhaps the most interesting finding was related to the attributes found in relation to workforce needs. A common link feeling of being a member of the team/crew was discovered between praise and job security. It was surmised that essentially a worker must first receive praise before they feel as if they are a member of the team/crew and once they feel like a member of the team, they then begin to acquire feelings of job security. The results of this study further reinforce the findings of several previous behavioral studies. Future research should attempt to validate the model using a larger sample size incorporating multiple general contractors.","Univ Florida, Sr Sch Bldg Construct, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Edwards Construct Co, Ocala, FL USA","Cox, RF (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sr Sch Bldg Construct, Rinker 304, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",robcox@ufl.edu; raymond-issa@ulf.edu,,,,,,22,19,19,1,15,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

SQFD integrates stochastic simulation modeling and analysis techniques into traditional QFD to deal efficiently with the uncertainties in the input data, to support the quality performance measurement that is involved in multi-attribute and multi-participant decision-making, and to predict the variability in the output. D/B construction owners who are in the process of selecting a D/B firm for a project would benefit from SQFD, because the system allows an owner to expeditiously assess the quality performance of potential D/B firms in their bidding list. An example in D/B contractor evaluation is presented to illustrate the functioning of the system. This quantitative method is a significant contribution to the field of quality performance measurement, because (1) SQFD is totally automated, (2) SQFD's reliability is higher than conventional QFD, and (3) SQFD efficiently deals with uncertainties in multi-attribute and multi-participant decision-making, and therefore generates more accurate results. The system helps to improve the D/B project bidding system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

While most previous models have been proposed to assist contractors in forecasting cash flow in the early stage of pretendering or the planning phase, this paper aims to provide a tool that can be applicable during the construction phase based on the planned earned value and the actual incurred cost on a jobsite level. The critical key to cash flow forecasting at this level lies in how to build a realistic cash-out model. Toward the end, this paper adopts moving weights of cost categories in a budget that are variable depending on the progress of construction works. In addition, it addresses time lags in accordance with the contractual payment conditions and credit times given by suppliers or vendors. As for the cash-in model, net planned monthly earned values are simply transferred to the cash-in forecast with a consideration of billing time and retention money. Validation of the proposed model involves applying realistic data from four ongoing projects. Based on the results of comparative analyses, the writers conclude that the proposed model is more accurate and reliable, yet simpler to field engineers who are generally not familiar with certain intricate financial knowledge.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI USA","Park, HK (corresponding author), Daewoo Engn & Construct Co Ltd, Seoul, South Korea.",parkhk@dwconst.co.kr; shh6018@yonsei.ac.kr; russell@engr.wisc.edu,"HAN, SEUNGHEON/G-8641-2015; Han, Seung Heon/G-8862-2012",,,,,24,57,58,1,26,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

While the subcontracting element needs more attention in contractor selection itself, subcontractor selection techniques themselves need considerable improvements. This paper examines how such techniques can beneficially draw from improved multicriteria contractor selection methodologies in general, and specifically from recent developments in client-contractor partnering. It is shown how partnering may be profitably extended further into the supply chain, i.e., into subcontractor selection. A European case study illustrates the development of a subcontractor selection process that incorporated partnering principles. Despite the longer and costlier selection process, it was found that subcontractor pricing levels were reduced by about 10% to account for anticipated efficiencies arising from the proposed partnering. Markedly better time and cost control was achieved on the pilot project. The relationships between all project participants were also found to have improved considerably. Such observations confirm the value (1) of expanding the partnering envelope to encompass subcontractors in general; and more specifically, (2) of assessing the potential for such extended partnering as an integral part of the subcontractor selection process.","Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civ Engrg, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Kumaraswamy, MM (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civ Engrg, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,"Kumaraswamy, Mohan/C-1802-2009",,,,,41,96,98,1,55,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

However, there are various challenges in the realization of prefabricated housing (PH) from the stakeholder's perspective. Transaction costs (TCs) theory provides a particular angle that explains the invisible costs within transactions. This study aims to explore how perceptions of TCs vary for stakeholder groups and show the potential to reduce TCs in China. The distribution of TCs related to stages and stakeholders was investigated by a literature study and validated by expert interviews. Further, an existing framework of TCs was adopted to conduct a questionnaire survey for collecting perceptions of TCs from six stakeholder groups. The findings show that assembly, detailed design, and design change are the most highlighted TCs of PH. In particular, the component suppliers complained of TCs from the points of detailed design and hiring skilled labor. The local government emphasized TCs on monitoring and enforcement in assembly, architectural design, and component transportation. This research contributes to the construction management community by acknowledging stakeholders in understanding their TCs, which also inspires the policy makers to reduce significant TCs to smooth transactions for the future of China's PH market.","[Wu, Hongjuan; Qian, Queena K.; Straub, Ad; Visscher, Henk] Technol Univ Delft, Management Built Environm, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands","Wu, HJ (corresponding author), Technol Univ Delft, Management Built Environm, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",H.Wu-2@tudelft.nl; k.qian@tudelft.nl; A.Straub@tudelft.nl; H.J.Visscher@tudelft.nl,,,"China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201606050102]; Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Delft University of Technology","This study is supported by the China Scholarship Council (No. 201606050102) and Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Delft University of Technology.

The asset involved in the project becomes the property of the government on its transfer. Thus, extending the concession period means an opportunity cost for the host government. By using an option-pricing model, this paper proposes a methodology for valuing the impact on the public budget arising from this option. This method can be of use in different transportation infrastructure projects, such as motorways, tunnels, and bridges. A case study is provided to show how the proposed methodology can be applied. The results confirm that the opportunity cost for the government may be high, and the main drivers behind this cost are the extension period, the base interest rates, and the risk premium of the government.","[Contreras, Carlos] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ Publ Econ & Polit Econ, Campus Somosaguas,Edificio 6, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Angulo, Julio] Int Ctr Infrastruct Solut, ICIS Grp, Calle Valle Ebro 8, Madrid 28669, Spain","Contreras, C (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ Publ Econ & Polit Econ, Campus Somosaguas,Edificio 6, Madrid 28223, Spain.",jc.contreras@ccee.ucm.es; julioangulo1950@gmail.com,,,,,,31,3,3,3,17,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

This study systematically integrates human factors in the form of worker competence into production scheduling. More specifically, the factors of worker learning rate, professional skills, experience in each type of operation, and operation specifications are all formulated to determine the duration of each process in precast production. A two-hierarchy scheduling optimization model (WCSO_PP) considering worker competence is proposed to synchronize the production scheduling with workforce development and to optimize the scheduling from both the short-term (time-oriented) and long-term (competence-oriented) views. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is validated using a real case study. The WCSO_PP model can achieve 74.09% and 73.01% cost savings in short-term and long-term scenarios, respectively. The developed model addresses the research gap in modeling the impact of human factors on the production, contributing to more reliable scheduling and enhancing the long-term human resource development.","[Wang, Zhaojing; Hu, Hao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhaojing; Hu, Hao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Gong, Jie] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 96 Frelinghuysen Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Hu, H (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.; Hu, H (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",zhaojin@sjtu.edu.cn; hhu@sjtu.edu.cn; jg931@rci.rutgers.edu,"wang, zhaojing/AAG-1892-2019","wang, zhaojing/0000-0001-6705-6082",Key Technology and Development Program in Shanghai of the Shanghai Commission of Science and Technology [14DZ1207101],"The authors express their sincere gratitude to Shanghai Jiangong Construction Material Company for assistance in observation and conducting on-site interviews.

Researches in developing economies (Ghana) have focused on the generic determination of cost contingency with little on the perspective of quantity surveyors who are the main players in the determination of contingency. The aim of this study was to identify the main triggers influencing the determination of contingency sum for building works from the perspective of Ghanaian quantity surveyors. Through literature, triggers were analyzed and ranked with relative importance index, also, Kendall's coefficient of concordance was used to measure the degree of agreement amongst public and private quantity surveyors. Though all the categories were relevant, economic, exogenous and technical were paramount. Taxation was among the least influential triggers.

Evaluating the financial consequences of these accidents is an effective method for measuring their impacts on owners, contractors, and society. While several studies have estimated the cost of injuries among different trades, demographics, event types, injury sources, and nature of injuries, most of these studies presented descriptive statistics without analyzing any inferential statistics regarding the differences between average costs. To address this limitation, this study utilized robust measures of location (trimmed mean) and scale (Winsorized variance) in a three-way factorial ANOVA design to examine the effect of variables on the cost of injuries among electrical contractors. To create a reliable accident database of electrical contractor injuries, the team aggregated 388 nonfatal accidents collected from the 2016 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) database. To determine the effectiveness of inferential statistical methods as applied to injury-cost analysis, null hypotheses were tested using three robust methods: (1) the Welch-type procedure; (2) an extension of Yuen's method; and (3) percentile bootstrapping. The results of the study confirm that robust hypothesis testing approaches can be successfully implemented on safety data even when the assumptions of conventional test statistics are violated. In terms of the electrical case study, the outcomes indicate that various event types and project end-uses can change the cost of injuries among electrical contractors. Specifically, the findings revealed that caught in/between and exposure to electricity accidents can, on average, lead to higher injury costs than fall to lower levels and struck-by objects/equipment accidents. In terms of project's end-use, construction accidents, on average, resulted in costlier injuries in nonbuilding projects than in buildings. The methodological results of this study can help contractors better quantify the risks of a construction project/task by estimating the severity of potential accidents in monetary values. Furthermore, this study contributes to the current body of safety knowledge by assessing alternative methods of hypothesis testing that do not require specific assumptions.","[Gholizadeh, Pouya; Esmaeili, Behzad] George Mason Univ, Sid & Reva Dewberry Dept Civil Environm & Infrast, Volgenau Sch Engn, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Gholizadeh, P (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Sid & Reva Dewberry Dept Civil Environm & Infrast, Volgenau Sch Engn, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",pgholiz@masonlive.gmu.edu; besmaeil@gmu.edu,,"Esmaeili, Behzad/0000-0003-3858-1843; Gholizadeh, Pouya/0000-0002-3694-5538",,,,99,3,3,0,3,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

As already discussed by previous researchers, these schedule compression techniques have direct impacts on project productivity and quality defects. Researchers have also pointed out that schedule compression will affect safety incidents such as Occupational Safety & Health Administration recordable injuries and near misses over long project durations. However, most of the existing studies treated safety as a subcategory of project productivity and project quality, and minimal research has been done to directly quantify the effect of schedule compression on safety at the project level. Therefore, in this research, we conducted a survey and statistical analysis to investigate the relationship between schedule compression and safety in construction projects.

Polish public procurement law, harmonized with EU guidelines on the subject, describes selection procedures in detail. Similar procedures are adopted by private sector clients as there exist no private sector specific procurement codes of practice. In the case of public procurement, the bid selection criteria have to refer to the object of procurement and not to the proprieties of a bidder. The client, in order to assure adequate quality of works (i.e. selection of a reliable and capable contractor) can, within the limits enforced by law, set conditions the bidders have to fulfill if they are to participate in a tender or negotiation procedure. The assessment based on criteria related with a bidder's technical and economic capability can be made also at the prequalification stage in restricted tendering procedures. The authors suggest the application of an extended fuzzy AHP method to the process of group decision making. This approach facilitates defining criteria weights by aggregation of decision makers' judgments. The paper presents an example that illustrates this approach to determining criteria weights for bidder assessment. The results show that the proposed fuzzy AHP method is superior to the traditional AHP in terms of improved quality of criteria prioritization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the study was to identify the nuances associated with the dominant health and safety management systems within these organizations and to categorize them into types. A qualitative descriptive research methodology was adopted, and data was collected through semistructured interviews involving safety managers, health and safety (H&S) advisors at employers' associations, and consulting firms. An analysis of the data revealed that the broad spectrum of health and safety management systems within contractor organizations in South Africa can be categorized into three distinct types. Defining features of the three HSMS types across three thematic areas were distilled.

To prevent collisions between workers and machines in excavation site construction, a real-time intelligent evaluation system to reflect worker-machine safety status was developed. The system included: (1) determination of the key factors affecting the safety of the interactive operation between workers and machines; (2) extraction of precursor semantic information related to the safety assessment for each object in the construction site based on machine vision; and (3) assessment of the safety state of a monitored object using a fuzzy neural network. A case study of excavation site construction is presented to illustrate and verify the entire process of safety assessment using the developed framework.

Research studies have identified the design aspect of projects as being a significant contributing factor to construction site accidents. Designing to eliminate or avoid hazards prior to exposure on the jobsite is also listed as the too priority in the hierarchy of controls common to the safety and health professions. Widespread implementation of the concept in the United States by engineering and architecture firms, however, is lacking due to perceived industry and project barriers. Given its absence from standard design practice, a question arises as to the viability of designing for safety as an intervention in the construction industry. This paper presents a pilot study that was conducted to investigate the practice of addressing construction worker safety when designing a project and, to determine the feasibility and practicality of such an intervention. Through interviews of architects and engineers, the study found that a large percentage of design professionals are interested and willing to implement the concept in practice. Among the perceived impacts of implementation, project cost and schedule were mentioned-most often along with limitations being placed on design creativity. The results of the pilot study indicate that designing for safety is a viable intervention in construction. The factors that impact the consideration of safety in-the design of a project do not entirely prohibit its implementation or make its implementation extremely impractical and therefore not feasible. Additionally, the outcomes of implementation provide sufficient motivation to implement the concept in practice. The paper describes the key changes needed for implementation of the concept in practice which include: a change in designer mindset toward safety; establishment of a motivational force to promote designing for safety; increase designer knowledge of the concept; incorporate construction safety knowledge in the design phase; utilize designers knowledgeable about design-for-safety modification's; make design for safety tools and guidelines available for use and reference; and mitigate designer liability exposure.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; E Carolina Univ, Dept Ind Technol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; Univ Florida, Sr Sch Bldg Construct, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Gambatese, JA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",john.gambatese@oregonstate.edu; behmm@mail.ecu.edu; hinze@ufl.edu,,"Behm, Michael/0000-0001-5715-4009",,,,27,123,126,2,52,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The results highlight the current subcontracting practices of main contracting firms that have resulted in a long-lasting market share abroad. Toward this aim, a detailed questionnaire was administered to 96 construction companies. Turkish and host countries' subcontractors were shown to be frequently employed in international projects. However, subcontracting firms from other countries were found to not be used. Main contracting companies generally select subcontractors in the periods after the main tender or after the project's start. Although many of them often work with previously known subcontracting companies and do not take into account the lowest bid price as the primary criterion, systematic processes or models are not used to select the best subcontractor. Most importantly, main contractors not only use subcontractors but also carry out activities using their in-house resources. Hence, this study will not only be a step for further works that can be performed by potential researchers who may find interesting similarities or differences between their countries and Turkey, but also assist contractors who plan to strengthen their positions and to increase work opportunities in the international market.","[Ulubeyli, Serdar] Zonguldak Karaelmas Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, TR-67100 Zonguldak, Turkey; [Manisali, Ekrem] Istanbul Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34320 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kazaz, Aynur] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey","Ulubeyli, S (corresponding author), Zonguldak Karaelmas Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, TR-67100 Zonguldak, Turkey.",serdar.ulubeyli@karaelmas.edu.tr; ekmanisa@istanbul.edu.tr; akazaz@akdeniz.edu.tr,"KAZAZ, Aynur/B-9177-2016","KAZAZ, Aynur/0000-0001-7926-7178; Ulubeyli, Serdar/0000-0003-0871-7391",Akdeniz UniversityAkdeniz University; Turkish Education Foundation,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the numerous chairpersons, managers, and other technical/administrative staff of the surveyed companies for their generous collaboration and contributions.

A mixed-method research approach sequentially combined nonparametric statistical analyses of survey responses to quantify the influence of behaviors on predictability and research charrettes with subject matter experts to assess the findings and characterize practical applications. Multiple behavioral factors, such as those associated with the design of incentives or the reporting environment, were documented to have a significant effect on predictability. This study contributes with a novel combination of behavioral and predictability focus to the body of knowledge in forecasting.

U.S. companies typically distinguish the role of design engineer, treated as a professional, from that of designer, treated as a worker who creates the detailed design. This paper discusses the roles of designers in the development engineering phase of product development, and examines the effects of designer communication, job design, organization climate, and CAD system quality on design quality. A survey of designers and design engineers at ten manufacturing sites was conducted. Communication with downstream processes, task significance, and job commitment were associated with greater achievement of manufacturability objectives. Communication with downstream processes and within the design core team were associated with achievement of strength objectives. Job commitment was a significant predictor of achievement of cost objectives. CAD system quality was not associated with any of the outcome measures. These results suggest that managers of development engineering organizations should treat designers more as professionals and less as workers. They should also redesign the jobs of both designers and design engineers to insure that the designers have greater responsibility and authority for linking with external groups.","UNIV MICHIGAN,IND & OPERAT ENGN,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109","FLEISCHER, M (corresponding author), IND TECHNOL INST,ANN ARBOR,MI 48106, USA.",,,,,,,34,30,30,2,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394",0018-9391,,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

By using Microsoft Visual C#, a system with the proposed approach is implemented and, thus, pay items and schedule information are automatically integrated.

Previous studies focused attention primarily on benchmarking the performance of contractors, but were mostly conceptual rather than from empirical findings. This continuous to pose a challenge to the sustainable development of the construction industry, particularly, in developing countries like Nigeria. There is therefore a need to identify, assess and compare performance practice levels of small scale contractors. Design/methodology/approach - The performance of each contractor was evaluated using a five-point Likert scale used in obtaining mean performance levels in respect to three classes of performance practices. A questionnaire survey was administered to major parties in the industry; clients, contractors and consultants who were selected by using a proportionate stratified random sampling technique. The contractors' performance was compared by using ANOVA with post hoc. Findings - The results indicated that the SSLGCs in Nigeria were average performers and there were effects and differences among the various contractors' levels of performance with international practice. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to SSLGCs in northern part of Nigeria. Practical implications - The study provided the criteria for evaluation of SSLGCs' performance in Nigeria and other developing countries that faced similar problems. Social implications - The study created bases for self-evaluation and competition among small scale contractors in Nigeria for the enhancement of productivity particularly in rural areas and general national development. Originality/value - This study emanated from the governmental reports and past researches in the area of performance management on the persistence of the poor performance of small scale contractors in construction industry.","[Gambo, Nuru; Ismail, Radzi] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Housing Bldg & Planning, George Town, Malaysia; [Said, Ilias] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Housing Bldg & Planning, Construct Management, George Town, Malaysia","Gambo, N (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Housing Bldg & Planning, George Town, Malaysia.",gambonuru@yahoo.com,,"ismail, radzi/0000-0002-7097-5802",,,,77,7,7,2,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

The aim of this study was to analyze human safety risk factors in subway construction in China and their interactions from a broad project-stakeholder perspective. Questionnaires were used to investigate cause-effect relationships among 42 factors identified from the literature and expert interviews. Weighted-network analysis showed that accidents and safety failures resulted from strong interactions of risk factors associated with multiple stakeholders. Owners' risk factors acted as a central risk source, amplifying risk and producing significant ripple effects on the global risk network. Many factors were associated with general contractors, but these resulted largely from risky acts by other stakeholders. These findings suggest that stakeholders should shift from separate risk mitigation to collaborative risk responses. This study improves understanding of the interactions of risk factors associated with diverse stakeholders. It also establishes a weighted-network approach to risk analysis that captures risk interactions more accurately than unweighted networks.

This paper presents a framework for classifying contractors using five of the most common clustering algorithms and assesses their performance with appropriate validity measures. The framework was implemented on actual data for 14 contractors working in UAE using a database of 294 projects. Quantitative measures were suggested and calculated for the contractors in the database. Qualitative measures were determined using AHP. The quality of contractor's staff and equipment was deemed to be the most important measure. The results show that contractors are grouped into four categories based on the quantitative and qualitative measures identified. The Fuzzy-C means algorithm had the highest validity measures when applied to the studied data set. The results show that the proposed framework can be used to categorize contractors into different performance groups in a rational and unbiased way. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although previous research efforts have analyzed factors related to subcontractor performance in regular financial conditions, there remains only sparse knowledge of how subcontractors are to survive when economic conditions become dire, as they have in recent times in the Spanish construction market. In this research, in-depth interviews with managers of relevant Spanish subcontracting companies were carried out, resulting in the identification of eight factors for subcontractor survival: project delivery method, demand, financial capital, relationship assets, managerial assets, human assets, legal framework, and geographic scope. The project delivery method used by the owner and also by the main contractor is mainly based on price. As a result, the subcontractors' bids get lower, making them unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, subcontractors do not get financial support from banks easily to cover their additional financial costs. These facts push subcontractors to get a guarantee of payment by the main contractor, and subcontracting companies may even ask for payments in advance. Subcontractors also seek long-term relationships with the contractor. These trusting relations are very often a prerequisite to qualify and bid for contracts. Subcontractors have to continuously improve, plan ahead, and adapt quickly to the new environment. Therefore, subcontractors must remain flexible and maintain a lean hierarchical organization. Doing so makes it is easier for subcontractors to compete in both their native markets as well as abroad. To this end, the most successful subcontractors have become international during the expansion phase of the economic cycle; many of them went abroad with the help of a contractor from their home country.","[Oviedo-Haito, Ricardo J.; Cardoso, Francisco F.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Engn Construcao Civil, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Jimenez, Jaime; Pellicer, Eugenio] Univ Politecn Valencia, Sch Civil Engn, Valencia 46022, Spain","Pellicer, E (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Sch Civil Engn, Camino Vera Sn, Valencia 46022, Spain.",mltca1@yahoo.com; jaijiay@cst.upv.es; francisco.cardoso@poli.usp.br; pellicer@upv.es,"Cardoso, Francisco/F-5189-2013; Haito, Ricardo Oviedo/AAE-5039-2019; Pellicer, Eugenio/B-5593-2012; Haito, Ricardo J.

Data collected from 195 respondents were analysed using Cronbach's coefficient alpha, Shapiro-Wilk and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The results indicate that OSH training is the most neglected factor, followed by non-inclusion of safety in contract documents and workers' non-involvement. Stakeholders have dissimilar perception about three OSH factors, including management commitment to OSH, safety rules/procedures and policies, and OSH training. Regulatory authority is suggested to launch OSH awareness campaigns, announce safety incentives, institutionalize the OSH certification system, and incorporate safety credit points in contractors' registration process.

Most of these studies have examined the safety of the construction site for workers or the traveling public. Illumination standards, sign requirements, and crash rate data have been studied to determine whether crash rates increase during nighttime hours, and the reasons for these crashes. Few studies have addressed either the effects on cost or productivity that nighttime construction has on a project. This study used hard bid unit prices to focus on the effect that performing certain construction activities at night has on cost and productivity. Specifically, the study assumes that a contractor's bid amount reflects expected relative project productivity and answers the question, What impact, if any, does night work have on construction productivity and therefore bid price? This is the first paper to answer both questions as related. Among the results was the fact that for the most part, the owner would have saved millions of dollars by allowing the contractor the option of working at night or during the day, though some items were bid lowest if the contract allowed for night work only.

They are responsible for ensuring that the technical specifications and design standards of mechanical, electrical and plumbing aspects of construction projects are adhered to with due consideration to budget and schedule. The quality of services offered by these consultants have however become a source of worry to clients recently in Nigeria as reflected in variance in the quality of services they render. This study examined clients' assessment of service quality of consultant services engineers in building project delivery. The study adopted survey research design with a total 121 responses obtained from target respondents using structured questionnaire administered to clients' organizations. The study adapted the 22 SERVQUAL service quality variables from literature. The study discovered that client's expectation of service quality of building services consultant exceeded the actual perceived service in building project delivery. Clients are unimpressed with the ability of the consultants to show sincere interest, provision of services at the time promised, the ability to give client specialized services relating to MEP and willingness to help client. Out of date software is being used and clients are rarely satisfied with consultants' responsiveness and assurance. It is imperative for service consultants to understand client's expectations and ensure such needs are met in the construction delivery process in order to ensure the service quality gap is eliminated. Finally, there is the need for consultants to be conscientious by timeously responding to all instructions and requests of clients as well as improve reputation which will ultimately pay off in project outcome.","[Oyeyipo, Opeyemi] Bells Univ Technol, Dept Quant Surveying, Ota, Nigeria; [Adeyemi, Bamidele] Estate Links Ltd, Lagos, Nigeria; [Osuizugbo, Innocent] Bells Univ Technol, Dept Bldg, Ota, Nigeria; [Ojelabi, Rapheal] Covenant Univ, Dept Bldg, Ota, Nigeria","Oyeyipo, O (corresponding author), Bells Univ Technol, Dept Quant Surveying, Ota, Nigeria.",oyeyipoo@gmail.com,,,,,,45,0,0,1,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

To fulfill these research aims, a structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to explore the relationships among social capital (including the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions); safety competency; and safety behavior (i.e.,safety compliance and safety participation), considering safety competency as a mediation variable. Data on these variables were collected via questionnaires answered by 535 construction workers who participated in 93 completed building projects in China. In regard to safety behavior, only the cognitive dimension, represented by shared language and shared goals, had a significant positive effect on safety behavior. The structural dimension, which includes network ties between supervisors and workers as well as the centralization of supervisors, had a significant negative effect on safety behavior. The relational dimension, characterized by mutual trust and reciprocity norms, had no direct or indirect effect on safety behavior. For the mediation effect, the cognitive dimension had an indirect, positive effect on this variable, considering safety competency as the mediation variable; the structural and the relational dimensions did not indirectly affect safety behavior. This paper provides a theoretical basis for construction supervisors to develop measures to improve workers' safety behavior from the perspective of relationships between people, and it points out the important role of safety competency in safety behavior. Unlike assumptions, the high level of the network has a negative effect on safety behavior, which should cause supervisors to pay attention to workplace safety management. In general, this study can inform management methods for improving workers' safety behavior and on-site safety conditions from the perspective of social capital.","[Li, Shuquan; Fan, Meng; Wu, Xiuyu] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Dept Management Sci & Engn, 25 Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China","Fan, M (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Dept Management Sci & Engn, 25 Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China.",lsq200612@126.com; fanmeng_0425@163.com; wuxiuyu1991@126.com,,"wu, xiuyu/0000-0003-0201-0379","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71571130, 71171140]",This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71571130 and 71171140).,,79,11,11,17,146,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

However, the differences between supervisors and construction workers are rarely examined. This study compared the safety climate, safety behavior (safety compliance and safety participation), and safety outcomes (injuries, unsafe events, and stress) between these two social groups. The relationships among these variables were also contrasted with each other using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The data were collected from 119 supervisors and 536 site workers at 22 construction projects in China. The results show that four dimensions of safety climate were distinctly different between supervisors and workers, which is consistent with the social identity theory. Two dimensions of the supervisors' safety behavior were significantly better than those of the workers' behavior, while supervisors suffered higher stress. The relationships between safety climate and safety behavior were positively associated for both groups. However, the links from safety climate to safety outcomes and from safety behavior to safety outcomes significantly differed between supervisors and construction workers, which revealed a complementation phenomenon. This study sheds light on group-level safety performance research. It also suggests that safety professionals should take group-targeted safety intervention measures and pay more attention to supervisors' psychological well-being.","[He, Changquan] Tongji Univ, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Sch Econ & Management, Tongji Bldg A1721,Zhangwu Rd 1, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [He, Changquan] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [McCabe, Brenda] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Construct Engn & Management Grp, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Jia, Guangshe; Sun, Jide] Tongji Univ, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Sch Econ & Management, Tongji Bldg A,Zhangwu Rd 1, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","He, CQ (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Sch Econ & Management, Tongji Bldg A1721,Zhangwu Rd 1, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.; He, CQ (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",changquan.he@mail.utoronto.ca; brenda.mccabe@utoronto.ca; jiagsh803@tongji.edu.cn; jdsun126@126.com,"He, Changquan/AAE-7330-2021","He, Changquan/0000-0003-4120-6075",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71472139]; International Cooperation Training Program for Graduate Students at Tongji University [2018XKJC-004],"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71472139) and the International Cooperation Training Program for Graduate Students at Tongji University (Grant No. 2018XKJC-004).

Unsafe behaviors, a direct cause of accidents, have been studied extensively, but few scholars have examined the role of social capital in improving workers' safety behaviors. Based on the social capital perspective, this paper explored how to improve the safety behaviors of construction workers in order to provide a theoretical basis for the study of improving workers' safety behaviors. Through a literature review and analysis, this paper presented the research hypothesis, constructed a structural equation model (SEM), and explored whether workers' social capital can affect their safety behaviors. The results showed that the structural and relational dimensions of workers' social capital have a significant and direct influence on their safety behaviors, whereas the cognitive dimension does not. The structural and cognitive dimensions significantly affect safety competency, but the relational dimension has an insignificant effect on safety competency. Safety competency significantly affects safety behaviors and has several mediating roles between the structural and cognitive dimensions and safety behavior. This paper provides a theoretical basis for enabling management personnel to develop and improve workers' safety behaviors based on interpersonal relationships. It shows that the interaction, trust, and common language between workers help to improve workers' safety behaviors.

Using interviews with five of the top 20 UK contractors and one medium-sized contractor, this study explored how main contractors manage the H&S influence of subcontracting with a focus on their in-house measures. Some in-house measures found are: restricting the layers of subcontractors on projects; working with a regular chain of subcontractors; implementing a H&S reward scheme for subcontractors; and insisting on non-working subcontractor foremen who have direct responsibility for the safety of workers in their trade. These measures appear to be influenced by clients, industry peer groups, and the moral justification for occupational H&S, and they offer inter-organisational learning opportunities for contractors in devising measures to mitigate the H&S influence of subcontracting. These findings should also allay concerns that removing some of the legislative hurdles in connection with ongoing red tape debate will result in poorer H&S. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

A sample of 450 questionnaire surveys regarding CWSB was collected from construction workers in several Chinese construction companies. EFA was used to extract eight common factors in order to identify the model structure among 28 questionnaire items. Then, SEM was employed to investigate the interrelationships among variables in the hypothesized safety behavior model. The built causal model was verified in terms of the hypothesis test and goodness-of-fit test. The impact of the path coefficient on CWSB was investigated and analyzed in detail. Results indicate that management-oriented supervision and system (F3) and leadership (F8) exert obvious positive impacts on CWSB in accordance with the path coefficients analysis, whereas psychological workers' condition (F5) and workplace conditions (F6) exert obvious negative influences. Individual differences among workers (F2) do not perform statistically significantly with workers' safety behaviors. The developed approach is capable of revealing causal-relationships, testing hypothesized models, and determining leading factors in complex project environments. This research provides insights into cause-effect relationships among the workers' perceived influential factors and goals, and the results can be used to understand the factors that the construction workers perceive as important factors in safety behaviors. This can further provide decision support on the improvement of construction safety performance in the context of the Chinese construction industry.","[Zhang, Limao] Univ Alberta, Hole Sch Construct Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2W2, Canada; [Liu, Qian; Wu, Xianguo] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Hole Sch Construct Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2W2, Canada.",limao_zhang@hotmail.com; liuqian660@foxmail.com; wxg0220@126.com; mirek@umd.edu,"Skibniewski, Miroslaw J./P-5310-2018","Zhang, Limao/0000-0002-7245-3741; Skibniewski, Miroslaw/0000-0002-7102-753X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51378235, 71571078]; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Fund [2014CFA117]","The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51378235 and 71571078), and Hubei Provincial Natural Science Fund (Grant No. 2014CFA117) are acknowledged for their financial support of this research.",,63,25,26,11,117,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Therefore, identifying workers with certain personal characteristics related to habitual insensitive response to safety risks potentially can help construction managers develop individualized safety training and interventions. Although the methods by which construction managers could identify those workers with specific personal characteristics have been limited, wearable sensors provide an opportunity for construction managers to monitor individual workers' behavior without any interruptions. This study investigated whether and how sensing data about workers' behavior around hazards can reveal their personality traits related to risk-taking behavior. In particular, this research focused on a personality trait well known to be related to risk-taking behavior, locus of control (LOC). An experiment was designed to collect workers' behavioral response to various hazards in terms of gait patterns; LOC was measured using standard instruments. The analysis showed that the degree of gait change around hazards is significantly correlated with LOC score. Additionally, those with internal LOC had more consistent gait patterns over a number of repetitive exposures to the same hazard (i.e., sustained sensitivity to safety risks) than those with an external LOC. These results demonstrate the potential of using wearable sensors to identify workers with personality traits associated with unsafe behavior.","[Sun, Cenfei] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, Coll Architecture, 330 Francis Hall, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Ahn, Seungjun] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, North Terrace & Frome Rd, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Ahn, Changbum Ryan] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, Coll Architecture, 330B Francis Hall, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Ahn, CR (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, Coll Architecture, 330B Francis Hall, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",csun@arch.tamu.edu; jun.ahn@unisa.edu.au; ryanahn@tamu.edu,"Ahn, Changbum R/R-6837-2017; AHN, SEUNGJUN/L-7000-2016","Ahn, Changbum R/0000-0002-6733-2216; AHN, SEUNGJUN/0000-0001-7427-8986",National Science Foundation (CMMI)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1538029],"The authors acknowledge Dr. Terry Stentz, Associate Professor, Durham School of Architectural Engineering and Construction, University of Nebraska at Lincoln; Dr. Hyunsoo Kim, Assistant Professor, Department of Architectural Engineering at Gyeongnam National University of Science and Technology; and Dr. Kanghyeok Yang, postdoctoral researcher at the Texas A&M University for their contributions to experimental design and data collection.

The study evaluated inadequacies in environmental attributes, as perceived by staff and residents, in four MBH facilities in the United States. The Psychiatric Staff Environmental Design tool and the Psychiatric Patient Environmental Design tool were used to capture perceptions and facility assessments. We examined the importance of various environmental attributes, the differences between the importance and how effectively these attributes were achieved, and the differences between psychiatric staff and resident responses. The most important qualities for residents were a well-maintained environment and suicide resistance. For staff, the most important qualities were staff safety and security and suicide resistance. Rated across all facilities, staff reported significant differences between importance and effectiveness of environmental attributes (p < .0001) whereas residents did not report differences. Significant differences were found between staff and patient ratings of existing facilities (p = .004), with staff reporting more inadequacies than residents. Findings suggest a strong need for more supportive physical MBH environments, particularly from the perspective of staff. Though residents reported fewer inadequacies, more evidence-based design guidelines for MBH environments are needed.","[Shepley, Mardelle McCuskey; Pham, Y.; Barankevich, Ruth] Cornell Univ, Dept Design Environm Anal, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Peditto, Kati] US Air Force Acad, Dept Behav Sci & Leadership, Colorado Springs, TX USA; [Sachs, Naomi A.] Univ Maryland, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Crouppen, Gary; Dresser, Karyn] Stars Behav Hlth Grp Inc, Long Beach, CA USA","Shepley, MM (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Design Environm Anal, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",mshepley@cornell.edu,,,,,,70,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

Design/methodology/approach The research methodology was based on taxonomic analysis to determine the coefficient of leadership potential in the following areas: financial growth of an enterprise, internal processes, human resources development and market potential. The examination process was grounded on the materials from small and medium-sized construction companies located in Russia and China. Findings Subgroups of companies with positive dynamics of indicators, an unstable situation and negative trends of leadership potential formation are identified. Russian small and medium-sized construction companies prioritize the development of sales policies and the management of internal business processes, while Chinese companies-human potential. The generated regression equations indicate a direct relationship between stakeholder engagement and the leadership potential of construction companies in both countries. Originality/value The scientific contribution of this study is the proposed methodological approach to assessing the development of the leadership potential of an enterprise and diagnosing the degree of stakeholders' influence on the latter. This is facilitated by comprehensive analysis, which includes an assessment of leadership potential based on the results of taxonomic analysis, construction of vector diagrams and regression analysis.

This paper presents a computational method called exact time-cost tradeoff (ETCT) in concurrency-based scheduling that identifies exact global overlaps between critical activities. It calculates the rework cost slope and amount by integrating the activities' concurrency attributes, identifies the exact global solution, and computes the probability to complete a project within the project completion time (PCT) and/or the project completion cost (PCC). The study is of value to project schedulers because ETCT identifies the exact global solution (i.e.,the set of activities to be overlapped and the exact overlap rates between these activities) expeditiously, and establishes a compressed schedule that satisfies a project's budget and duration constraints. This is also relevant to researchers in that it clearly defines the computational formula to compute the exact solution in detail and facilitates a comparison of the outcome of a schedule under different project objectives, such as minimizing project completion duration and/or project completion cost.

Randolph; Ellis, Ralph D., Jr.",,,Contractor prebid planning principles,JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Planning is an essential function of project management. Yet, many small- and medium-sized contractors do a relatively poor job of operational planning. Better prebid plans will reduce costs, shorten schedules, and improve labor productivity. Unfortunately, the published literature offers little guidance for smaller contractors on what constitutes effective planning. Most papers describe planning as a macrolevel process for owners. Most emphasize scope definition for industrial projects. This paper describes a microlevel planning process for contractors. It consists of eight steps which are: (1) assess contract risks; (2) develop a preliminary execution plan; (3) develop site layout plans; (4) identify the sequences that are essential-to-success; (5) develop detailed operational plans; (6) develop proactive strategies to assure construction input into design; (7) revise the preliminary plan; and (8) communicate and enforce the plan. The entire process is illustrated with a case study project and is fully illustrated with figures which show how to integrate the work of multiple contractors, keep key resources (crews or equipment) fully engaged with no downtime, provide time buffers so the work of follow on crews can be efficiently done, expedite the schedule using multiple work stations and concurrent work, ways to communicate the work plan to the superintendent and foremen, and how to assess the feasibility of various work methods. The steps are easy to understand and implement. They will yield immediate positive results.","Penn State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Penn Transportat Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Civil & Coastal Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Thomas, HR (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Penn Transportat Inst, 201 Transp Res Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",hrt1@psu.edu,,,,,,9,10,10,0,12,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The existing management method for detecting workers' unsafe behaviors and unsafe states of objects relies primarily on manual monitoring, which does not only consume large amounts of time and money but also cannot cover all workers in the entire construction site. Meanwhile, the workers' perception of being at risk of injury decreases when they are concentrated in a crowded and noisy environment. In this case, it is difficult for them to take essential measures to protect themselves in the face of danger. In view of the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a method of evaluating the collision safety level of construction workers based on computer vision and fuzzy inference. Specifically, the proposed model works via two modules: vision extraction and safety assessment. The vision extraction module identifies construction workers and equipment through computer vision; centroid pixel coordinates and crowdedness are then extracted from a detection box. Afterward, the spatial relationship between moving devices and workers is calculated by a pixel calibration process. In the safety assessment module, the collected status information is analyzed by evaluating the safety level of each worker and conducting accident prevention through a fuzzy inference system. The safety level, which indicates the comprehensive risk of collision between workers and equipment in a particular dynamic environment, will be displayed numerically, breaking through the limitations of conventional qualitative evaluation. Field experiments validate the feasibility of the proposed method of informing workers about potential danger situations in an objective way. Moreover, by setting a safety-level threshold, the onsite safety management personnel can take corresponding measures to avoid collision accidents when the worker's safety level is lower than the threshold.","[Zhang, Mingyuan; Cao, Zhiying; Yang, Zhen] Dalian Univ Technol, Dept Construct Management, Dalian 116000, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xuefeng] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Dalian 116000, Peoples R China","Zhang, MY (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Dept Construct Management, Dalian 116000, Peoples R China.",myzhang@dlut.edu.cn; zycao@mail.dlut.edu.cn; yangz@mail.dlut.edu.cn; zhaoxf@dlut.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of ChinaFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [DUT18JC44]; Natural Science Foundation of Liao Ning ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [2019-MS-052],The presented work is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (No. DUT18JC44) and the Natural Science Foundation of Liao Ning Province 2019 (No. 2019-MS-052).,,33,6,6,8,36,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Additionally, by breaking down the uncertainty of an accident cause occurring, SimSAFE provides factor-sensitivity information to support safety risk management. Enhancing knowledge of the safety factors (such as safety training and site environment) to which an activity (or path or zone) is sensitive, and also of the activities (or paths or zones) that are most sensitive to a particular factor can provide management with a better sense of what factors and activities (or paths or zones) need to be controlled for reducing construction accidents, especially for a large project or multiple projects.

One key aspect of a credible and sustainable CSR system is to ensure that those companies seeking registration are assessed according to reliable standards and mechanisms. In practice, many managers rely on intuition, experience or predictive judgment to deal with the dynamic but interrelated requirements originating from various subcontractor and work categories. Being an artificial intelligence approach that mimics human problem solving skills, the case-based reasoning (CBR) approach should have potential in providing a flexible, transparent, objective and simple CSR system. This paper describes the development of a case-based CSR system. The results of this paper should improve our understanding on the process of CSR, evaluation criteria and information requirements. The case-based CSR model will also help formulate a more structured standard for the evaluation of subcontractors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The latter is often giving preference over the former in the award of contracts and stakeholders consider this practice unhealthy for growth and development. This study evaluates the influence of the quality performance of the two categories of contractors on their patronage. The objectives are to determine the level and difference in the patronage and quality performance of indigenous and expatriate contractors and the correlation between clients' assessment of the quality performance and patronage of indigenous and expatriate contractors in the Nigerian construction industry. To achieve these objectives, a field survey involving a sample of 43 clients selected from the population of organised clients in Nigeria was conducted. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data. The data collected were analysed to determine the ranking and test of difference in clients' patronage and clients' assessment of quality performance between the two categories of contractors using mean and t-test respectively. The correlation between patronage and quality performance was analysed using Spearman correlation test. The study established that expatriate contractors are being giving preference in the award of contracts. It also established that clients perceive the quality performance of expatriate contractors to be better than that of indigenous contractors and attributed the preference in patronage to this difference. It suggested that indigenous contractors should embark on measures that will improve their quality performance in order to stop the preference for expatriate contractors.","Univ Lagos, Dept Bldg, Fac Environm Sci, Lagos, Nigeria","Idoro, GI (corresponding author), Univ Lagos, Dept Bldg, Fac Environm Sci, Lagos, Nigeria.",iroidoro@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,40,15,15,0,3,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

Living environment plays a role in enhancing elderly quality of life (QoL), however, the impact of the built environment and care services are under-studied. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of the built environment and care services on the QoL of elderly people within rural nursing homes in China. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 242 residents of nursing home were surveyed, of which 76 percent were male and 24 percent were female. In total, 25.6 percent were aged between 60 and 69, 40.1 percent between 70 and 79, 31 percent between 80 and 89, and 3.3 percent were 90 or above. Quantitative data were analyzed through factor analysis, reliability test and multiple regression modeling. Findings - The authors identified six built environment factors (room distance, space, barrier-free design, indoor environment, fire safety, and support facilities) and three services factors (i.e. daily care services, cleaning services, and healthcare services). QoL was measured over four dimensions: QoL, physical health, psychological health, and social relationships. Elderly QoL could be accurately predicted from room distance, space, barrier-free design, indoor environment, daily care services, and cleaning services. Practical implications - Interventions in design of the built environment and the provision of care services are proposed, including dimensions of living space, heating, and provisions for qualified care providers. Originality/value - This paper provides a clear picture about elderly special requirements on their built environment and healthcare services, helping architects, engineers and facilities managers understand elderly needs and improve built environment during design and operation stages.","[Yu, Jingyu; Jiang, Xiaoyan] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Ma, Guixia] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Marxism, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China","Yu, JY (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",yujingyu@hfut.edu.cn,,"Jiang, Xiaoyan/0000-0003-0954-5843",Anhui Social Science Program [AHSKQ2015D39]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M581985],The work described in this paper was fully supported by a grant from the Anhui Social Science Program (Project No. AHSKQ2015D39) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Project No. 2015M581985).,,44,9,9,5,44,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Although research has established that PCS is critical to safety management in construction sites, there is limited evidence on how PCS affects construction workers' safety behavior, including compliance and participation. Building upon the psychological contract theory and social exchange theory, this study investigates the mediating mechanisms that link PCS to safety compliance and safety participation, that is, felt safety responsibility and safety-specific trust in supervisors. Overall, 389 valid data points from multiple sources comprising construction workers and their supervisors from 15 construction projects were collected. The results reveal that felt safety responsibility and safety-specific trust in supervisors partially mediate the relationships between PCS and both safety compliance and safety participation. The findings extend the safety behavior literature by clarifying the two distinct PCS processes toward safety behavior. Interventions should target improving employees' perception of PCS to support their engagement in safety behavior.","[Wang, Xueqing; Qiao, Yuhan] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, 92 Nankai Dist, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dan] Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, 174 Shazheng St, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Zitong] Curtin Univ, Future Work Inst, Perth, WA 6000, Australia; [Newaz, Mohammad Tanvi] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia","Wang, D (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, 174 Shazheng St, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.",wxq@tju.edu.cn; qiaoyuhan_1997@tju.edu.cn; wangxiaodan@cqu.edu.cn; zitong.sheng@curtin.edu.au; tanvi.newaz@newcastle.edu.au,,,,,,77,0,0,6,6,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

A rule-based engine that utilizes this framework is implemented on top of a commercially available BIM platform to show the feasibility of the approach. As a result, the developed automated safety checking platform informs construction engineers and managers by reporting, why, where, when, and what safety measures are needed for preventing fall-related accidents before construction starts.

Unless planned properly, such requirements can cause serious financial constraints for investors. The push for sustainability adds a new dimension to the complexity of evaluating highway projects. Finding environmentally and socially responsible solutions for highway construction will improve its potential for acceptance by the society and in many instances the infrastructure's life span. Even so, the prediction and determination of a project's long-term financial viability can be a precarious exercise. Existing studies in this area have not indicated details of how to identify and deal with costs incurred in pursuing sustainability measures in highway infrastructure. This paper provides insights into the major challenges of implementing sustainability in highway project development in terms of financial concerns and obligations. It discusses the results from recent research through a literature study and a questionnaire survey of key industry stakeholders involved in highway infrastructure development. The research identified critical cost components relating to sustainability measures based on perspectives of industry stakeholders. All stakeholders believe sustainability related costs are an integral part of the decision making. However, the importance rating of these costs is relative to each stakeholder's core business objectives. This will influence the way these cost components are dealt with during the evaluation of highway investment alternatives and financial implications. This research encourages positive thinking among the highway infrastructure practitioners about sustainability. It calls for the construction industry to maximize sustainability deliverables while ensuring financial viability over the life cycle of highway infrastructure projects.","[Goh, K.

The developed EFHNN combines neural networks (NN) and high order neural networks (HONN) into a hybrid neural network (HNN), which acts as the major inference engine and operates with alternating linear and non-linear NN layer connections. Fuzzy logic is employed to sandwich the HNN between a fuzzification and defuzzification layer. The authors developed and applied the EFHNN to assess subcontractors performance by fusing HNN, FL and GA. Enhancing subcontractor performance assessments are crucial in terms of providing to general contractors information on historical contractor performance essential to guiding a selection of appropriate subcontractors for a specific current or future subcontracting need. Results show that the proposed EFHNN may be deployed effectively to achieve optimal mapping of input factors and subcontractor performance output. Moreover, the performance of linear and non-linear (high order) neuron layer connectors in the EFHNN was significantly better than performances achieved by previous models that used singular linear NN.

Understanding the nature of this kind of uncertainty can reduce the level of inconsistency that reinforces the safety management system in CI. The purpose of this paper is to present an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy-improved score function and weighted divergence based approximation (IVIF-ISF-WDBA) approach for ranking main stakeholders with clear duties that can influence workers' unsafe behaviours as well as risk reduction in final decisions. In this method, a score matrix is compiled based on improved score performance and IVIF decision matrix, and then a linear programming model is developed to determine the weight of unknown criteria. In addition, a divergence measure has been developed to find out the degree of performance of the alternatives. Next, we perform comparative and sensitivity analyses with different proposed methods and different weight criteria sets to determine the stability of the developed approach. The results indicated that the most effective safety factors (ESFs) are safety climate factor(3) (SCF3) (safety management rules and regulations) at 45%, and safety perceptual factor(2) (SPF2) (workers' preferences and behaviours related to safety category) at 25%. The LP-model ranked client, designer, construction manager, and contractor as the authoritative bodies that should carry out extensive inspections of ESFs, namely, SCFs, SPFs, and workplace condition factors (WCFs) in the preconstruction phase. However, these priorities can change during the construction phase among the contractor, construction manager, supervisor, client, and designer. This study concluded that workers' unsafe behaviours could be linked to stakeholder duties in complex and dynamic conditions of the CI.","[Khoshnava, Seyed Meysam] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Inst Smart Infrastruct & Innovat Construct, UTM Construct Res Ctr, Sch Civil Engn,Fac Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Rostami, Raheleh] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Architecture, Sari Branch, Sari, Iran; [Zin, Rosli Mohamad] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Mishra, Arunodaya Raj] Govt Coll Jaitwara, Dept Math, Satna, MP, India; [Rani, Pratibha] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Math, Warangal, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Mardani, Abbas] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Informetr Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Mardani, Abbas] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Business Adm, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Alrasheedi, Melfi] King Faisal Univ, Sch Business, Dept Quantitat Methods, Al Hufuf, Saudi Arabia","Mardani, A (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",abbas.mardani@tdtu.edu.vn,"Mardani, Abbas/D-5700-2015; Rostami, Raheleh/AAN-9970-2021; MISHRA, ARUNODAYA RAJ/M-2404-2019; Alrasheedi, Melfi/AAB-7376-2021","Mardani, Abbas/0000-0003-1010-3655; MISHRA, ARUNODAYA RAJ/0000-0001-9949-5813; Alrasheedi, Melfi/0000-0002-3911-2152",,,,97,7,7,11,27,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

The influences of the four referent characteristics to mental model formation were not equivalent. Concreteness was the best predictor, followed by ease of visualization, familiarity, and context availability. The higher the visual imagery vividness of construction workers, the higher the proportion of their mental models for sign referents that were recognized as stereotypes. Other user factors had no significant effect on mental model formation. This knowledge of how user mental models of sign referents and how the representation was built in user minds would be beneficial for practitioners to enable better processing and practicing mental model approaches to safety-signs design for use in sites.

Thus, research is needed to identify the motivational factors determining off-site construction workers' safety behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to investigate workers' safety behavior by examining the determinants of behavioral intention in the off-site manufacturing plants in China. Design/methodology/approach Theory of planned behavior (TPB) was modified and used in this study to explain how the elements in the hypothesized model interact. Data were collected using a questionnaire. Structural equation modeling technique with partial least-squares estimation was used to analyze the data collected. Findings The findings of this study indicated that workers' tendency to engage in safety behavior is positively related to attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and behavioral habit, among which attitude toward the behavior and behavioral habit have most significant influences on safety behavior. This finding provides a better explanation on the pathways and the impacts of the crucial factors on the safety behaviors for the off-site manufacture. Originality/value The possible innovation of this research lies in its attempt to understand the antecedents of workers' safety behavior in the off-site construction environment, which may make original contributions to construction safety research and practice. The findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge in TPB. Corresponding countermeasures are put forward in order to improve workers' safety behavior in off-site construction.","[Liu, Qinjun] Chongqing Univ, Sch Construct Management & Real Estate, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qinjun; Feng, Yingbin] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Ye, Gui] Chongqing Univ, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Ye, G (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",19478760@student.westernsydney.edu.au; yegui760404@126.com; y.feng@uws.edu.au,,"Liu, Qinjun/0000-0002-4746-0480; Feng, Yingbin/0000-0002-3832-0152",,,,69,3,3,9,53,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Design/methodology/approach Drawing from supplier development theories and practices in the manufacturing sector, a mixed interpretivist and empirical methodology is adopted to examine the body of knowledge within literature for conceptual model development. A self-reporting survey questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale is used to assess 30 construction professionals' perceptions of the effectiveness of 37 SC development practices classified into five categories. Descriptive statistics, weighted means, and t-tests are used for data analysis. Findings SC prequalification, commitment, incentives, evaluation and feedback practices can be effective in generating high-performing SCs. Practices that require more direct involvement and linkages between GC and SC are perceived to be less effective. Research limitations/implications Theoretical contributions include a framework to foster future research to advance knowledge and understanding to enhance the adoption of SC development practices in the construction sector. Practical implications Implementation of ranked SC development practices can equip GCs with a network of high-performing SCs for improved competitive advantage and revenues. Originality/value The proposed conceptual model expands discussions on the modification of supplier development theories and practices currently utilized in the manufacturing sector toward their application in the construction sector.

Previous studies have discussed the benefit of cooperation or partnering among subcontractors and between them and other project stakeholders. However, there has been limited research to quantify the benefit of cooperation among subcontractors in performing high-reliable planning (HRP). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to quantify the benefit of cooperation among subcontractors in increasing their planning reliability at an operational level. Although HRP reduces the variability in a production system that significantly benefits the downstream subcontractors, it requires every subcontractor to put more time, cost, and effort into the planning stage, which may not be cost-effective for upstream subcontractors. To model the described situation, a simulation model (built by simulation software) was integrated with a cost model that identifies the relationship between cost and work-plan reliability (WPR) level. By utilizing different benefit-allocation models and evaluating their solutions, the paper demonstrates that a contribution-based benefit-allocation (CBBA) model using a game theory framework can provide the most acceptable and incentivizing solutions for the benefit-allocation problem. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in lean construction by quantifying the benefit of subcontractors' cooperation in increasing their planning reliability.

Data were obtained via a questionnaire based on Kano model concepts to categorize the identified selection criteria. The obtained results show that the selection criteria can be categorized into three categories; must-be, one-dimensional, and attractive. According to this categorization, the weight of criteria is extracted by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Then, a fuzzy multi-attribute decision framework is developed to select the best SC with two main components, screening by the must-be criteria category and selection based on the one-dimensional and attractive criteria categories.

Consequently, numerous latent hazards remain unidentified, which poses significant risks to construction workers. To advance current hazard identification capabilities, this study examines the feasibility of harnessing and analyzing collective patterns of workers' bodily responses (balance, gait, etc.) to identify safety hazards on a jobsite. To test the hypothesis that the abnormality of workers' bodily responses in one location highly correlates with the likelihood of a safety hazard in that location, this project collected data on the bodily responses of 10 subjects who participated in five experiments. These test subjects wore inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors on their body. Then the collected response data were analyzed using three metrics [average, standard deviation, and Shapiro-Wilk statistic (W)]. The data showed that the normality of workers' bodily response distributions-represented as a W statistic-highly correlated with hazard locations in every experiment, which implies that workers' bodily responses in hazardous areas are more irregularly distributed than in nonhazardous areas. This outcome demonstrates an opportunity for utilizing workers' collective bodily responses to identify safety hazards in diverse construction environments.

This work interprets the mechanisms of an electrical accident as a chain of decision mistakes throughout the entire task process. The objective of this paper is to visualize the decision-making chains in workplace electrical safety for construction workers. Because of construction's one-off nature, the researchers narrow the decision-making chain for specific features of work (FOW), a group of distinct activities possessing higher occupational safety and health (OSH) risks and requiring particular attention. By analyzing National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) electrocution reports, the authors identify five features of work and illustrate their decision-making chains. This work promotes electrical safety and injury prevention through the decision-making lens and contributes to the scholarly body of knowledge by introducing a comprehensive approach to the decision-making chain that is applicable to other safety research.

Design/methodology/approach The model is based on the constraint programming (CP) framework; it integrates multiple scheduling characteristics of repetitive activities such as continuous or fragmented execution, atypical activities and coexistence of different modes in an activity. To improve project performance while avoiding inefficient hiring and firing conditions, the strategy of bidirectional acceleration is presented and implemented, which requires keeping regular changes in the execution modes between successive subactivities in the same activity. Findings Two case studies involving a real residential building construction project and a hotel refurbishing project are used to demonstrate the application of the proposed model based on four different scenarios. The results show that (1) the CP model has great advantages in terms of solving speed and solution quality than its equivalent mathematical model, (2) higher project performance can be obtained compared to using previously developed models and (3) the model can be easily replicated or even modified to enable multicrew implementation. Originality/value The original contribution of this research is presenting a novel CP-based repetitive scheduling optimization model to solve the multimode resource-constrained time-cost tradeoff problem of repetitive projects.

We apply our approach to read and understand a longitudinal case study of an Information System (IS) project. Our most important findings suggest that this approach based on ANT improves stakeholders' analysis of and engagement in a project by shedding light on the dynamic and emergent nature of the relationships, since we demonstrate that the nature, roles, and relations between stakeholders co-evolve with the project's definition and trajectory.

An application example of a repetitive construction project is analyzed to evaluate model performance and demonstrate its capabilities in optimizing the scheduling of repetitive construction projects.","[Altuwaim, Ayman; El-Rayes, Khaled] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Altuwaim, Ayman] King Saud Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Altuwaim, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Altuwaim, A (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",altuwai2@illinois.edu; elrayes@illinois.edu,,,,,,36,18,18,4,46,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

This study ascertains the relative importance of a set of internal and external factors for the intensity of technological and non-technological innovation among construction contracting firms. Seventeen types of contractor activities, associated with three levels of service content, are identified and a characteristics-based theory of service innovation with four innovation trajectories (material, informational, methodological, contractual or relational) is applied. Data collected from a questionnaire survey of 44 of the 50 largest construction contractors in Sweden indicate that 30 contractors had carried out research and development during 2003-2005 and that 11 had made at least one innovation new to the country. The lowest level of innovation intensity was mostly linked to the methodological trajectory (28 contractors), while the material trajectory dominated innovation 'new to the country' (eight contractors). Analysing data per activity where research and development or innovation had been reported shows that collaboration with another type of contractor is associated with a higher intensity of innovation, regardless of trajectory. The level of employee education is significant for relational innovation. The consequences for policies in firms and central government are identified.","Chalmers, Dept Technol Management & Econ, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden","Brochner, J (corresponding author), Chalmers, Dept Technol Management & Econ, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",jan.brochner@chalmers.se,"Brochner, Jan/E-4825-2018","Brochner, Jan/0000-0002-1961-0330",Swedish Construction Industry (SBUF),"Thanks are due to the participants of the Swedish and French Working Seminar in Paris (CSTB, November 2005) on Service Innovation Theories and Construction for many helpful suggestions; as well as those who contributed to the RIDE Workshop at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, April 2006; the IoIR/ASEAT Conference 2006 on Innovation in Services, Manchester; and the Copenhagen Business School Conference on Micro-Processes of Managing the Construction of Buildings, November 2006.

Few contractors specify and follow systematic schedule monitoring practices. Traditionally, the earned value method (EVM) is used to control and monitor schedule performance using the schedule and cost performance indices which compare the budgeted cost of work performed to what was originally scheduled or what is actually expended. This paper presents a statistical approach, namely Weibull analysis, to evaluate stochastically the schedule performance of construction or design projects. The approach can be used in conjunction with the EVM to enhance the evaluation and control of schedule performance. Weibull analysis is a common method for failure analysis and reliability engineering used in a wide range of applications. In this paper, the applicability of Weibull analysis for evaluating and comparing the reliability of the schedule performance of multiple projects is presented. The various steps in the analysis are discussed along with an example in which two projects are analyzed and compared. The authors conclude that Weibull analysis has several advantages and provides a relatively robust and effective method for construction managers to better control and monitor their projects.","Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA; N Dakota State Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Construct, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; Bradley Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Construct, Peoria, IL 61625 USA; Calif State Univ Northridge, Civil Engn & Appl Mech Dept, Northridge, CA 91330 USA","Nassar, KM (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA.",knassar@umes.edu; khaled.nassar@ndsu.nodak.edu; mhegab@csun.edu,,,,,,13,21,23,1,13,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The construction industry is one of the largest industries, and at the same time, among the largest polluters. Thus, the concept of sustainability has become increasingly important to construction firms and many contractors have started to reduce the environmental impacts of their construction activities. As part of the effort to achieve sustainability in construction sector, the study develops a method to select earth-moving equipment, based on their environmental impacts as well as duration and cost considerations. To this end, the study initially devel- ops a model for determining construction costs and duration as well as a model for determining monetary environmental impacts on earthwork construction. The study then uses an Improved Weight Decision Method (IWDM) to determine the weight of variables in order to find the best performed equipment configuration.

The prevailing assumption that corporate investment in information technology will immediately result in more efficient business operations and inevitably improve the standard measures of business performance is now highly suspect in many U.S. industries. It is not uncommon for companies to be dissatisfied with their information technology investments, and to be frustrated over their inability to objectively quantify the anticipated process benefits. These issues raise two important questions: (1) how can companies objectively measure the potential benefit of information management investments?; and (2) what information management strategies can be successful in construction engineering? This paper summarizes a research project designed to specifically answer these two questions. A methodology is provided to objectively predict the project schedule and cost impacts of process changes that may result from strategic investment. The methodology is then used to identify the potential impact of three proposed information management strategies on the construction engineering process should the strategies by implemented successfully. The research concluded that substantial cost and schedule reductions result from improving internal information exchange and integrating project-based information across organizational boundaries.","Arthur Andersen & Co, Dallas, TX 75202 USA","Back, WE (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",,,,,,,19,23,24,0,27,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",0742-597X,,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

A modeling framework, developed in previous research, was used to develop a conceptual model of a project that depicts a causal structure of the variables, risks, and interactions that affect a contractor's performance for a specific project from the owner's point of view. The conceptual model helps to identify information needed for a comprehensive evaluation; some information can be readily available from historical records, while other can be unavailable and can be replaced by estimates based on experience. Ideally, over time, the owner should collect most of the information required for future evaluations. A mathematical component of the model can generate predictions of multiple project performance outcomes for each contractor under evaluation; these predictions and a contractors' bid prices are then used for contractor evaluation purposes.","Catholic Univ Chile, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile","Alarcon, LF (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Chile, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Escuela Ingn, Casilla 306,Correo 22, Santiago, Chile.",lalarcon@ing.puc.cl; cmourgue@ing.puc.cl,"Mourgues, Claudio/E-4236-2014; Alarcon, Luis/F-8371-2013","Alarcon, Luis/0000-0002-9277-2272",,,,23,48,51,1,15,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

This uniqueness requires marketing practices tailored specifically to match the construction market. A questionnaire survey of 65 U.S. contractors was conducted to determine the extent to which they are implementing a modified marketing mix theory that is compatible with the construction industry. The modified marketing mix theory recommends that contractors confront marketing from five perspectives, known as the five P's of marketing: product, price, promotion, place, and people. This study showed that the five P's of marketing are used by U.S. contractors in this decreasing order: product, price, place, promotion, and people. According to the survey results, U.S. contractors allocate about 1.5% of their annual revenue to marketing, but they may be spending more than they report.

This study focuses to explore gaps in entrepreneurial skills, traits and knowledge in quantity surveying education to foster entrepreneurial quantity surveyors (QS) to the industry. A questionnaire survey was conducted with quantity surveying entrepreneurs and graduates with a strong intention of an entrepreneurial career, passed out with a bachelor's degree in quantity surveying which resulting in 15 duly completed responses with 100% respond rate, through convenient sampling method. Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) matrix was constructed to identify shortages in skills, traits and knowledge offered by the degree programme to produce entrepreneurial QSs. Seven skills/traits and three knowledge areas were identified as under-developed areas in the undergraduate education. The findings of the research will create an impact to revisit educational needs to cater the industry's demand for entrepreneurs. Further industry can convert the over qualified areas into opportunities to take immediate advantages towards the profession.","[Sampath, Dhanushka; De Silva, Nayanthara; Withanage, K.

Inconsistencies in their definition and determination have rendered such costs often being cited inappropriately to support a case for addressing poor quality in construction. Quality failure costs, which are expressed in the form of nonconformances (NCRs) costs, are derived and analyzed for 218 projects delivered by a contractor between 2006 and 2015. A total of 7,082 NCRs are categorized and quantified in accordance to their cost, and the differences among project type, procurement, and contract size are statistically examined. The analysis revealed that (1)mean NCR costs were 0.18% of OCV; (2)structural steel and concrete subcontracted works had the highest levels of NCRs; and (3)differences were found in the cost of NCRs among different procurement methods and contract sizes. The research provides the international construction community with invaluable insight into the real costs of quality failure that have been borne by a contractor. Thus, the paper makes a call to reinvigorate the need to engage with performance benchmarking so as to engender process improvement throughout the international construction industry.","[Love, Peter E.

Design/methodology/approach - A method of deriving refined definitions for a group of terms by ensuring there are no unnecessary elements causing internal conflict or overlap is adopted and applied to resolve the confusion. Findings - The refined definitions of stake and stakeholder are in terms of an interest and activity. This avoids all extensions of meaning introduced by defining particular types of stakeholders and/or their degrees of impact. It also resolves the multiplicity of conflicting meanings possible when silent or assumed qualifiers of a word are ignored, restricting definition to, for example, project stakeholders or stakeholders of a firm. These definitions are carried forward into a mapping of the stakeholder locus of interest on an activity rather than a company base, enabling generic categorisation of stakeholders to be proposed for use in both private and public sectors. A governance difficulty with the term customer also emerged and a resolution to this is proposed. Research limitations/implications - Resolution of the academic contention around the definition of stakeholders will facilitate future research endeavours by removing confusion surrounding the term. It can also provide clarity in governance arrangements in public and private sectors. Verification of the method used through its success in deriving this refined definition suggests its suitability for application to other contested terms. Practical implications - Projects and businesses alike can benefit from removal of confusion around the definition of stakeholder in the academic research they fund and attempt to apply. Social implications - A refined definition of the stakeholder concept will facilitate building social and physical systems and infrastructure, benefitting organisations, whether public, charitable or private. Originality/value - Clarity results in the avoidance of confusion and misunderstanding together with their consequent waste of time, resources and money.","[McGrath, Stephen Keith; Whitty, Stephen Jonathan] Univ Southern Queensland, Fac Business Educ Law & Arts, Springfield, Australia","McGrath, SK (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Fac Business Educ Law & Arts, Springfield, Australia.",kasmac99@yahoo.com.au,"McGrath, Stephen Keith/AAH-5113-2020; Whitty, Stephen J/D-4666-2015","McGrath, Stephen Keith/0000-0003-2617-495X; Whitty, Stephen J/0000-0003-3969-4516",,,,43,6,6,3,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

It introduces the concept of combined effect of different risk factors to the accident. For proper safety planning, safety managers need to be well aware of the direct causes of the accident as well as indirect factors that adversely effect on site safety. If it is observed that if a hazardous environment exists at the site, then either that hazardous environment must be eliminated or occupations and processes related to that hazard must be properly protected. One of the measures for evading such hazardous situations is to predict such situations and to reschedule the start time of high-risk situation so that risks are not concentrated during certain periods and at certain locations. In order to predict when and where the risk will reach its highest level, analysis should be performed based upon various information including statistical sources such as accident histories and this should be done in coordination with the activity scheduling. This paper analyzes the result of accident history and provides information about vulnerable situations. In addition, it presents a theory of safety planning method which estimates the risk distribution of a project and helps the safety manager to both estimate situations of concentrated risk and then to reschedule it when it is necessary.","Univ Strathclyde, Dept Architecture & Bldg Sci, Glasgow G4 0NG, Lanark, Scotland; Hankyong Natl Univ, Dept Safety Engn, Ansung 456749, Kyonggi Do, South Korea","Langford, D (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Architecture & Bldg Sci, 131 Rottenrow St, Glasgow G4 0NG, Lanark, Scotland.",d.langford@strath.ac.uk,,,,,,19,45,46,0,17,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The research described in this paper represents a major study in this area and significantly advances the understanding of the impact of quality upon building costs. Building design, construction, operating, maintenance and rehabilitation cost data for 215 buildings were collected from all available sources in the Canadian Department of National Defence. A metric was developed to measure quality in the design, construction, and operating and maintenance phases of a building's service life. An analysis of variance of annual equivalent total costs, for the first 20 years of building service life, clearly indicated that quality had a major impact on total costs when the influence of all other potential factors, particularly age, was minimized or removed. It was found that quality, in particular design quality, has the greatest demonstrable impact on building maintenance and rehabilitation costs.","[Newton, Linda A.] Def Construct Canada, Infrastruct Support Serv, Ottawa, ON K1P 5J3, Canada; [Christian, John] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Civil Engn, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada","Newton, LA (corresponding author), Def Construct Canada, Infrastruct Support Serv, 141 Laurier Ave W,Suite 801, Ottawa, ON K1P 5J3, Canada.",linda.newton@dcc-cdc.gc.ca,,,Canadian Department of National Defence; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; M.

Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) promises to support contractors in dealing with this challenge. However, the ability of MCDA to ensure decision quality in the specific context of infrastructure tenders has gained little attention. By undertaking a longitudinal case study on early design decisions in a tender for a design-build project in the Netherlands the relationship between MCDA and decision quality is investigated. The case results show that in the early tender phase the decision making very much relies on the experience and knowledge of engineers. If MCDA is inappropriately used in such a context it can create impressions of soundly underpinned evaluations of design options while neglecting uncertainties and leading to low-quality decision. Although MCDA defines the what is required for structuring the decision problem, it does not support decision-makers in the how to do it. The explicit consideration of decision quality elements in MCDA can support the how and can create awareness for decision makers concerning importance, scope and uncertainty of criteria.","[van der Meer, Jeroen; Hartmann, Andreas; Dewulf, Geert] Univ Twente, Dept Construct Management & Engn, T300,POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [van der Horst, Aad] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Delft, Netherlands","van der Meer, J (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Construct Management & Engn, T300,POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",j.p.vandermeer@utwente.nl,,"Hartmann, Andreas/0000-0003-3753-5378",,,,51,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

This paper fills this gap by empirically investigating the effect of the level of owner-provided design on the design quality of contractors in DB projects. Questionnaires were collected from 243 Chinese project professionals and hierarchical regression analysis was conducted. Empirical results reveal that the level of owner-provided design negatively affects design innovation and positively affects design change. The contractor's competence strengthens the effect of owner-provided design level on design innovation. A minimum proportion of owner-provided design can improve design quality. It is also necessary to ensure the clear articulation of requirements in the request for proposal (RFP). The findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the level of owner-provided design and the contractor's design quality in DB projects. These findings also give owners insight into the preparation of the RFP with regard to the optimal level of design.","[Zhang, Shuibo; Liu, Xinyan; Gao, Ying; Ma, Pei] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China","Ma, P (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",zhangshuibo@tju.edu.cn; liuxy_07@163.com; ygao@tju.edu.cn; mapei@tju.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71572124, 71231006]",This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71572124 and 71231006).

The modified theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was proposed by using attitudinal ambivalence to replace univalent safety attitude. Empirical data were collected from 229 construction workers in China using a detailed questionnaire. Both situational and routine safety violations were considered in this model. The results showed that LMX had significant effects on both types of safety violations through three mediators from the modified TPB framework. Specifically, attitudinal ambivalence and group safety norm mediated the relationships between LMX and both types workers' safety violations. However, perceived behavioural control only mediated the relationship between LMX and individuals' routine safety violations. Furthermore, this research supported the distinctions between situational and routine safety violations. The indirect effects of LMX on individuals' situational safety violations took place mainly through group safety norm. By contrast, the indirect effects on individuals' routine safety violations took place mainly through attitudinal ambivalence and perceived behavioural control. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications, research limitations, and future directions were discussed.

Then, a structural equation model (SEM), in which project performance was regarded as a mediator variable, was established to investigate the path and intensity of ICS application capability on contractors' competitiveness. A questionnaire was distributed to the project personnel of Chinese contractors engaged in international projects, and 174 valid questionnaires were collected. The results show that 1) relationship management and technical support have a direct driving effect on the competitiveness of contractors; 2) talent guarantees and organization guarantees affect contractors' competitiveness through project performance.

In this paper, we present findings from the analysis of five case studies of systems engineering projects for large government enterprises. We focus on what can be learned from systems engineers, their essential role, and their engineering practices. As they work to establish interoperability across preexisting and new technologies, thereby evolving an infrastructure, the engineers commonly face agonistic tensions between groups of stakeholders. Temporal pacing conflicts are especially prevalent, such as those between some stakeholder groups concerned with fast-paced streams of innovation and others concerned with current operations. In response, many engineers are following an evolutionary approach, developing new capabilities for incremental modularization and re/integration of technologies and associated practices across organizational (stakeholder) boundaries. Additionally, engineers are leveraging their professional role and developing new skills of influence to support these capabilities for addressing stakeholder tensions. We close by discussing implications of our findings for the management of infrastructure technology projects, for organizational design and engineering of government enterprises, and for the changing role of systems engineers.","[Brooks, JoAnn M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Carroll, John S.] MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Carroll, John S.] MIT, Engn Syst Div, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Beard, Jon W.] George Mason Univ, Sch Management, Informat Syst & Operat Management Dept, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Beard, Jon W.] Mitre Corp, Bedford, MA 01730 USA","Brooks, JM (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",joann.m.brooks@vanderbilt.edu; jcarroll@mit.edu; jbeard2@gmu.edu,,,MITRE,"Manuscript received September 30, 2009; revised March 15, 2010; accepted May 27, 2010.

During the bidding process, selecting the most appropriate sub-contractors (SCs) for the relevant sub-works is highly critical for the overall project performance. In order to select the most appropriate SCs for the project and prepare the most realistic and accurate bid proposal, general contractors (GCs) have to know all financial, technical and general information about these SCs. Within this context, GCs should consider several factors in the selection process. These factors may include the quality of production, efficiency, employment of qualified members, reputation of the company, accessibility to the company, completion of the work on time etc. This paper proposes a web-based sub-contractor evaluation system called WEBSES by which the SCs can be evaluated based on a combined criterion. It enables GCs to select the most appropriate SCs for their relevant sub-works, speed up the selection process and gain time and cost savings during the bidding process. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Data were collected from 257 multiple stakeholders in Singapore using a KAP questionnaire and seven semistructured interviews with DfS professionals, architects, developers, and project managers. The results indicated that the DfS knowledge level of survey participants needs to be improved. The majority of respondents demonstrated a positive attitude towards DfS, but the average level of DfS practice was low. Statistically significant differences in DfS practice were found between developers/clients, CS engineers, and project managers. Three recommendations for improving DfS implementation were proposed: (1)enhance DfS training programs, (2)establish a DfS Community of Practice, and (3)develop DfS courses in tertiary institutions. The findings of this paper can help in the design of strategies to improve the implementation of DfS in the construction industry at the national level and the approach can be used to track the effectiveness of DfS-related interventions across time.

The effectiveness of WHS risk management relies on decision makers' ability to decide appropriate strategies to mitigate/control risks. However, it is unclear whether upstream decision makers share similar WHS risk perceptions with those who undertake the construction work. This study used Q methodology to explore WHS risk perceptions of architects, engineers, construction managers, and WHS professionals. Photographs depicting different technologies/methods were used to capture professionals' WHS risk judgments. Data were analyzed to identify the within-group and between-group similarity/difference in professionals' WHS risk perceptions. The data-analysis result indicates the coexistence of within-group difference and similarity, as well as between-group difference and similarity in WHS risk perceptions. The research contributes to the body of knowledge by showing that WHS risk is subjective in nature and that social, psychological, and technical factors interact to shape subjective risk judgments. The research finding challenges traditional risk-management thinking, which assumes risk is objective and easily quantifiable.","[Zhang, Peihua; Lingard, Helen; Blismas, Nick; Wakefield, Ron] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Kleiner, Brian] Virginia Tech, Myers Lawson Sch Construct, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Zhang, PH (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",rita.zhang@rmit.edu.au; helen.lingard@rmit.edu.au; nick.blismas@rmit.edu.au; ron.wakefield@rmit.edu.au; bkleiner@vt.edus,"Wakefield, Ron/AAC-1048-2020","Wakefield, Ron/0000-0003-0058-6008; Lingard, Helen/0000-0003-3645-8390; Zhang, Rita Peihua/0000-0001-9907-6491","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [OH009761]","This work was supported by Cooperative Agreement OH009761 from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

While there has been research into the impacts of various forms of industrialized construction on the construction sector, surprisingly there has been little research into the impacts on subcontractors. The lack of subcontractor's voice in the industrialization debate is important to address since they operate at the coalface of the industry where the impacts of such changes will have a significant impact. The resource based view of the firm (RBV) is used as a theoretical lens to study these potential impacts through interviews with senior executives and managers of six major subcontracting firms which have worked with off-site bathroom pod technologies in Australia. It is found that the key subcontractor resources affected by this off-site technology are human, financial, intellectual and social and that subcontractors will need to pursue strategies which develop new skills, knowledge, networks and deeper supply chain collaborations if they are to turn the potential risks associated with off-site into potential opportunities to achieve competitive advantage.","[Goh, Edward; Loosemore, Martin] Univ New South Wales, Fac Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Loosemore, M (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Fac Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",m.loosemore@unsw.edu.au,,"Loosemore, Martin/0000-0002-3189-4655",,,,96,14,14,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

It also tested the moderating role of this leadership in the personality-safety behavior relationship. One hundred twenty workers completed the Big Five personality test and graded their supervisors' leadership, and the workers' safety behavior was assessed by the supervisors. The results showed that conscientiousness was related positively with safety compliance. Contrary to our theorizing, agreeableness was related negatively with safety compliance. Leadership always positively related to safety compliance and participation, and it also attenuated the relationships of conscientiousness and agreeableness with safety compliance. This enhances the importance of considering safety leadership as an antecedent and intervention of employee safety behavior. However, conscientiousness and agreeableness remained related with safety compliance when safety leadership was considered simultaneously. These findings expand the limited research on the personality-safety behavior relationship in the construction field. Evaluating conscientiousness and agreeableness prior to recruitment can enable employers proactively to curtail unacceptable safety transgressions. Enhancing supervisors' safety leadership helps to prevent employees from performing safety-related actions that are subject to individual dispositions.","[Xia, Nini; Tang, Yuchun; Li, Dezhi; Pan, Ao] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China","Tang, YC (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.",ninixia@seu.edu.cn; tangyuchun@seu.edu.cn; njldz@seu.edu.cn; 213172332@seu.edu.cn,,,"Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of the Ministry of Education of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [20YJCZH183]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [72002030, 71772136]; National Social Science Foundation of China [19BGL281]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20200383]","This work was supported by Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of the Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 20YJCZH183), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 72002030 and 71772136), the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 19BGL281), and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (Grant No. BK20200383).

However, their deployment in the field of construction is less well understood. The aim of the research reported in this paper was to investigate whether 'best practices' such as these, could be applied in sectors of the construction industry to provide sustainable competitive advantage. To facilitate the investigation an action research based methodology was employed in which the researchers took an active role in the change process. This method was chosen because of its practical orientation, its predisposition to longitudinal case based applications and its suitability to 'proof of concept' initiatives. This research was carried out over a three year period and focused on the implementation of these practices with a view to improving the performance of a subcontractor in the construction industry. The outcomes of the research indicate that, despite the high levels of uncertainty and product variety that characterise the industry the principles of close coupling value chain functions can be applied to subcontractor operations that are primarily manufacturing orientated and that improvements in production and assembly productivity are possible with the result that total costs can be reduced and delivery performance improved.

This paper describes a research study of lean and safety principles and practices with regards to worker behavior and safety practices. Specifically, the study aimed to investigate the extent of alignment between lean construction principles/practices and worker behaviors associated with construction safety. To conduct the study, the researchers used a multistep process involving a comprehensive literature review, document content analyses by an expert panel, and a survey of industry practitioners knowledgeable about lean construction. The findings support the perspective that many similarities exist between the application and impacts of lean and safety principles and practices. Lean practitioners surveyed believe that implementation of the last planner system as a lean practice is most beneficial to the following safety practices: management commitment, preproject planning, and pretask planning. The present study revealed that lean principles and practices can provide a valuable opportunity to further improve construction worker safety; however, the findings show that there is a difference between lean construction and safety management practices, revealing a gap with respect to worker behavior. Understanding and eliminating this gap is important for the industry to realize the full benefit that lean principles and practices can have on worker safety. To do so, the authors suggest expanding lean practices to further directly engage field workers and address worker behavior issues along with carefully communicating the lean message to construction personnel.

The value ranges, representing different degrees of performance, were determined from related research and tested by real data. The results show that the values and scores derived from the defined ranges effectively differentiate performance, which means the C/SPIs and ranges are well defined. The two-level C/SPIs and value ranges can enhance the application of the earned value concept and evaluate design project performance more systematically and accurately.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan","Chang, AST (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",,,,,,,18,17,18,2,6,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted with purposively selected built environment consultants in Ghana within a case study (The Kumasi City Mall project). Thematic template analysis revealed designer?s own philosophy, request by clients, incentives for green designs, policies and regulation, and competitive advantage as the drivers of environmental sustainability of construction projects. Furthermore, the results disclosed specific governmental role and social network utilization as drivers of environmental sustainability of construction projects.

The construction industry is large, volatile, and requires tremendous capital outlays. For developing economies, road construction constitutes a major component of the construction industry. This means that much of the national budget on infrastructure development is channelled to road construction projects. The aim of the study reported in this paper was to identify causes and effects of cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects. Using a detailed literature review, structured interviews and questionnaire surveys, the results of the study confirmed the prevalence of cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects in Zambia. The study established that bad or inclement weather due to heavy rains and floods, scope changes, environmental protection and mitigation costs, schedule delay, strikes, technical challenges, inflation and local government pressures were the major causes of cost escalation in Zambia's road construction projects. On the other hand, delayed payments, financial processes and difficulties on the part of contractors and clients, contract modification, economic problems, materials procurement, changes in drawings, staffing problems, equipment unavailability, poor supervision, construction mistakes, poor coordination on site, changes in specifications and labour disputes and strikes were found to be the major causes of schedule delays in road construction projects. Appropriate project management practices are thus required to curb the causes and effects of cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

Experiential judgement is required in decision situations when it would be too costly to measure a large amount of information quantitatively and it is also invaluable in providing shortcuts for complex tasks. However, the quality of heuristic knowledge depends upon the experiences of the decision-makers. The development and use of a case-based reasoning (CBR) system can help decision-makers to produce more reliable and expeditious decisions for contractor prequalification. An Expert preQUALifier - EQUAL - has been developed using the CBR approach. This paper describes the components of EQUAL and illustrates the functionality and operation of the system through a trial run with hypothetical cases. The results of testing reveal that experts were satisfied with the accuracy and overall performance of EQUAL, and CBR approach is suitable for modeling the contractor prequalification domain.

However the existing CICSs, including Masterformat, put the emphasis on architectural construction. Furthermore, project managers have difficulties in using the existing CICSs when they need to manage information throughout all construction phases, because most CICSs attach weight to specified phases, such as construction operations, which are carried out on site. This study suggests a tentative CICS for civil engineering projects, and the CICS consists of four facets with mnemonics in a notation system. Facility and space facets are grouped by the classified items for the management in upper levels through construction phases, and element and operation facets are classified to apply to the management in lower levels. The proposed CICS with four facets enables project managers to control a project with common information both for cost estimating and for schedule planning. Creating the CICS with such a common information system is helpful for connecting project cost for a project organizer with the construction schedule for a site manager, and the connection between cost and schedule will make better information management for a construction project.","Gyeongsang Nat Univ, Ind Technol Res Inst, Dept Civ Engn, Gyeongnam 660701, Jinju Si, South Korea","Kang, LS (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Nat Univ, Ind Technol Res Inst, Dept Civ Engn, Gyeongnam 660701, Jinju Si, South Korea.",,,,,,,12,19,20,2,22,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

More specifically it investigates: the perceived level of trust that currently exists between subcontractors and main contractors; the factors affecting trust at the project level; the relationship between trust and productivity. Design/methodology/approach - An on-line survey was undertaken with of 112 senior construction managers working for tier-1 and tier-2 subcontractors in the Australian construction industry. The survey was based on a combination of validated questions from Lau and Rowlinson's (2009) interpersonal trust and inter-firm trust in construction projects framework and Cheung et al.'s (2011) framework for a trust inventory in construction contracting. Findings - In contrast to the large number of research projects which have highlighted a lack of trust in the construction industry, the findings show that level of trust that Australian subcontractors have in main contractors is generally high. However, bid shopping is a continuing problem in the Australian construction industry which acts to undermine trust. The findings also provide strong evidence that high levels of trust influence productivity on site by enabling greater collaboration, better communication and greater flexibility, agility and informality in project relationships. Research limitations/implications - This research was undertaken in the Sydney metropolitan area in Australia and within an economic boom. It is quite possible that outside this regional context which tends to dominated by larger construction firms and in an alternative economic context that the results of this research could be quite different. This possibility needs to be investigated further. Practical implications - The results indicate that this relatively healthy level of trust is down to good communication and empathy on the part of main contractors to the subcontractor's welfare. While the results showed that bid shopping is clearly a continuing problem in the Australian construction industry, subcontractors also felt that their contracts were clearly defined and that they were given sufficient time to innovate on their projects. This suggest that new communications technologies can be used to build trust through the supply chain. Given that much of the construction supply chain is made up of small- to medium-sized businesses, the challenge of diffusing these new technologies into this business environment should be a priority. Social implications - Trust in basis of effective collaboration which has been shown to produce numerous social benefits such as greater equity and justice in business relationships and higher levels of productivity and safety. Originality/value - The originality of this research is in using theories of trust to give subcontractors a greater voice in the construction productivity debate.","[Chalker, Mathew; Loosemore, Martin] Univ New S Wales, Fac Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Loosemore, M (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Fac Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",m.loosemore@unsw.edu.au,,"Loosemore, Martin/0000-0002-3189-4655",,,,62,21,21,3,47,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Despite its practical relevance, solution methods to solve this problem are scarce in the literature. The proposed algorithms combine the flexibility of an activity with the flexibility of a resource to select the next activity to be scheduled. Several priority rules from the literature were tested, and the best heuristic was selected. The proposed heuristics' performances were compared with the mathematical formulation solved by an optimization software within a time limit, and the probabilistic constructive heuristic found optimal and near-optimal solutions for small instances. For medium and large instances, it obtained better results than the optimization model in about 20 times lower computational time. The heuristic was also compared with existing solution methods and was applied to a construction practical example, with good overall performance.","[Su, Connie Tenin; Santoro, Miguel Cezar] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Ind Engn, Ave Prof Almeida Prado,Trav 2,128, BR-05508070 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Mendes, Andre Bergsten] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Ave Prof Mello Moraes 2231, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Su, CT (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Ind Engn, Ave Prof Almeida Prado,Trav 2,128, BR-05508070 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",connietsu@hotmail.com; santoro@usp.br; andbergs@usp.br,"Santoro, M.

Like any other method, LOB has certain disadvantages that create a set of practical limitations in its application. An LOB schedule gives insights about how continuous and synchronized single resources are scheduled and how uniform these resources are distributed over the project duration. However, these three characteristics have to be visually checked, which makes the evaluation and the comparison of different schedule alternatives difficult. To overcome this problem, the purpose of this paper is to present a quantitative method to calculate quality degrees for the continuity, the synchronization and the uniformity of an LOB schedule that can be applied to assess an LOB schedule globally. Design/methodology/approach The paper introduces a set of global indicators, termed quality degrees, which allow for a quick quantitative evaluation of LOB schedules at the global level. These quality degrees are quantitative indicators for the: degree of continuity, degree of synchronization and degree of uniformity within a specific LOB alternative. A mathematical model was developed to calculate the quality degrees for LOB schedules. This model was validated using a well-known case study extracted from literature, and its practical implementation was exemplified on two real Romanian projects. Findings The paper illustrates this contribution using two case studies that confirm that the proposed method can be used to evaluate different schedule alternatives. In particular, the paper shows that quality indicators can be used to analyze and control interdependencies between cost and time. Originality/value The paper proposes an innovative method, mathematically formulated, to quantitatively assess the quality aspects of continuity, synchronization and uniformity for LOB schedules.","[Ungureanu, Lucian Constantin] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Hartmann, Timo] Tech Univ Berlin, Fak Planen Bauen Umwelt 6, Berlin, Germany; [Serbanoiu, Ion] Univ Tehn Gheorghe Asachi Iasi, Iasi, Romania","Ungureanu, LC (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",l.ungureanu@tu-berlin.de,,,,,,49,0,0,3,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

A survey was conducted in Hong Kong to test the relationships between contractors' network performance and successful business competitiveness based on the project networks they build. A network strategy was developed by examining the relationships between the network techniques and the network outcomes. The network techniques support contractors' network, whereas the network outcomes contribute to competitiveness attributes. The findings demonstrate that the key network techniques of supporting information exchange and organizing project communication are highly significant predictors of the business competitiveness attributes (BCA). The network technique of creating learning capacity is positively associated with contractors' bidding performance and competitive strategies. Interestingly, the techniques of sharing knowledge and promoting networking culture insignificantly contribute to a number of the BCA. The developed network strategy reveals that the key network techniques significantly support contractors' network performance and that the consequent network outcomes give rise to the BCA, which in turn stimulate contractors' business competitiveness. Several practical suggestions are offered for contractors to improve their business competitiveness through interfirm cooperation between project network members.","[Keung, Calvin] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Shen, Liyin] Chongqing Univ, Sch Construct Management & Real Estate, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Keung, C (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",cwkeung@cityu.edu.hk,,,,,,78,10,10,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Findings suggest that research on stakeholder management has focused strongly on those stakeholders able to control project resources, whilst the effect on the legitimate 'secondary stakeholders', such as the local community, remains widely unexplored. Due to the unavoidable impact of major PIC on both people and places, it is suggested that seeking local community opinions in the initiation phase of the project and monitoring the megaproject impact at the local level can help to improve project performance.

A broad variety of safety measures have been implemented on sites, such as encouraging workers to put on personal protective equipment and launching regular safety toolboxes. This has tended to strengthen safety awareness and improved compliance with safety regulations. The study of discrepancies in psychological climate among workers and how psychological climate interacts with external factors thus plays a prime role in understanding safety. This paper examines external factors with psychological climate that the workers possess on their safety awareness. A questionnaire survey was conducted in the construction industry in South China (Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macau). A research hypothesis model is thus developed for understanding the interrelationship among parameters with respect to workers' psychological conditions. It emerged that two external factors. physical working environment and social influence. affect psychological conditions, whereas negative affectivity, risk-taking tendency and perceived utility of safety measures affect the safety awareness of the workers. Of these, the physical working environment has the strongest influence on negative affectivity and the perceived usefulness of safety measures has the strongest influence on safety awareness.","[Fung, Ivan W.

The importance of identified skills was examined using Mean item score; Spearman's rank correlation was employed to test relationships while Mann-Whitney test was used to examine the difference in opinions of respondents. The most important skills required for procurement officers are technical and tactical skills. Although, the level of exhibition of these skills by quantity surveyors is a little above average, their performance is low in comparison with the level of importance of the skills. The identified skills are not significantly exhibited by quantity surveyors and their areas of strength are inversely proportional to the importance of the skills.

The main aim of this study is to propose a new technique for SS by adopting Choosing By Advantages (CBA). The selection factors for subcontractor are determined. CBA principals, steps, merits and some of its applications in the construction context are demonstrated. Proposed SS technique is then developed, implemented on a case study and compared with recent methods in literature. The main contributions to the body of knowledge are as follows: (1) propose equations which determine exactly how to assess the percentage advantage for each factor for quantitative factors, qualitative factors with different grades/ranks, and qualitative factors on a yes/no basis and (2) subcontractors attain a positive utility when they are able to combine a low price with a superior level of five factors, which are: reputation, acknowledgement certificates, qualification of staff, amount of work in the last five years, and estimated time of the project. Globally, this technique is highly beneficial to industry practitioners because it will facilitate the subcontractor selection process.","[El-Kholy, A.

Nevertheless, the underlying responsibilities of the key stakeholders (clients, consultants, and contractors) in managing this chronic problem in the Australian construction industry remain unclear. By performing an in-depth analysis of the roles and responsibilities of these key stakeholders, this research is intended to unfold the industrywide perception of cost performance being heavily reliant on the contractor's performance alone. Based on a thorough literature review and relevant industry inputs, 73 attributes associated with cost performance were identified for investigation. Based on the relative importance weighing technique on 48 selected attributes, planning and scheduling deficiencies have the highest impact on cost performance from clients, consultants, and contractors' perspectives. Confirmatory factor analysis on the combined responses across all three groups suggests that robust control procedures and adequate programming, along with efficient design and effective site management, are the most critical factors. These factors are primarily associated with the responsibilities of contractors and consultants for managing cost overruns in projects. However, the client's responsibility in facilitating effective management of these factors within the project environment is crucial. Multivariate regression analysis performed on eight factors' scores highlighted the influence of five significant factors (p < 5%) on managing cost overruns. The findings are expected to abridge a significant knowledge gap by shifting the priorities in cost estimation and management practices across all industry sectors.

It is crucial, therefore, to appraise the performance of subcontractors to ensure they satisfy the client's expectations and project requirements. To increase the transparency and accuracy of subcontractor appraisal, the baseline and target performance levels should be set at the outset so that the appraisers and those being appraised realize exactly what standards are to be achieved. The balanced scorecard, being a powerful tool for performance appraisal, offers a potentially good approach for modeling the subcontractor appraisal process. In this paper, an approach to developing a balanced scorecard subcontractor appraisal model is proposed and demonstrated through a questionnaire survey administered in Hong Kong and from which the baseline and target performance levels for large-scale skilled subcontractors are identified. A case example is used to illustrate the operation of the model. Finally, a means by which the model may be validated is demonstrated through the use of field experts. The results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a balanced scorecard model that can help improve the transparency of subcontractor appraisal despite the baseline and target performance levels changing according to the project characteristics, subcontractor categories and size.","[Ng, S.

A challenge in these settings pertains to the need to share skilled resources across concurrent projects when project management is schedule-driven and resource capacity is fully committed. To probe into this problem, we use a system dynamics simulation grounded on in-depth fieldwork with a high-performance truck developer. We simulate the effects of capturing resources allocated originally to one project so as to speed up another product development project that started late. Our central contribution is to illuminate how a schedule-driven project management policy can lead to a vicious cycle that degrades the organization's capability to meet the planned project milestones in the long-term. Whilst capturing resources can ensure that a tardy but 'business-critical' project is delivered on time, if the organization has no free resource capacity and is also not recruiting more staff, this practice harms the schedule performance of the projects deprived from resources. Further, the workforce's productivity gradually deteriorates as the frequency with which staff switches back and forth between projects increases. These effects compounded cause delays in all the subsequent projects, irremediably degrading the organization's capability to deliver projects on time reliably. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Even with the most expert understanding of construction contract clauses and the most equitable risk-allocation regime, claims will continue to present problems if they are poorly managed in practice. The research reported in this paper was aimed at identifying shortcomings, and their causes, in claims-management practice. It consisted of a comprehensive review of literature on the subject, a postal questionnaire survey of, and interviews with, contractors and consultants, and case studies of claims on projects. A major finding is that claims management is not treated as a management function on the same footing as estimating, planning, scheduling, and cost control. It is poorly resourced and performed in an ad hoc manner. As a consequence claims-related issues are too often put in abeyance until project completion when necessary resources are released from recognized functions. Issues, documents, and information normally at the center of disputes have been identified.

First, the replicated dynamic equation set is established in terms of expense targets. Second, the equilibrium solutions of the equation set are obtained to test strategy options. The trends of system fluctuations caused by penalty and reward changes are also analyzed. Finally, the stability of the proposed model is improved by integrating a dynamic penalty-reward scenario into the evolutionary strategy of the PO. Simulation results show that: 1) the evolutionary stable strategy does not exist in initial interactions, 2) the degrees of penalty and reward considerably affect the CC's rate variable, and 3) the dynamic penalty-reward scenario could effectively improve the stability of the proposed modeL The unsteadiness of the quality supervision system and the stability control scenario could help in understanding the impact of interactions among stakeholders and provide suggestions for optimizing quality supervision procedures.","[Gu, Shengyu] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Pan] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Pan] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Construct Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jianying] Wuhan Ctr China Geol Survey, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China","Zhang, P (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Zhang, P (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Construct Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhangpan2017@hust.edu.cn,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [170649]; Research Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China [15YJA630019]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71573237]; China Institute of Geo-environment Monitoring [0001212016CC60013]","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) under Grant [number 170649]; the Research Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China under Grant [number 15YJA630019]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant [number 71573237]; China Institute of Geo-environment Monitoring under Grant [number 0001212016CC60013].",,52,15,15,12,46,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

Since the success of the project highly depends on the performances of the subcontractors, selecting the right subcontractor for the right job is critical. Main contractors generally tend to select the subcontractors that offer the lowest bid price. However, working with unqualified and insufficiently financed subcontractors may result in inefficiencies and failures. Thus, a combination of several compromising and conflicting criteria underpinning financial capacity and competencies of the subcontractors should be considered during the subcontractor selection process. This paper proposes an integrated decision approach, which employs analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) together, for the subcontractor selection problem. In the proposed approach, AHP is used to analyze the structure of the subcontractor selection problem and to determine the weights of the criteria, and PROMETHEE is employed to obtain complete ranking and perform sensitivity analysis by changing the weights of criteria. The proposed approach is applied to a problem of selecting the most appropriate subcontractor to be worked with in an international construction project. Company management found the proposed decision approach satisfactory and implementable in future subcontractor selection problems.","[Polat, Gul] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Insaat Fak, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey","Polat, G (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Insaat Fak, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey.",polatgu@itu.edu.tr,"POLAT, GUL/ABB-3256-2020","POLAT, GUL/0000-0003-2431-033X",,,,64,38,38,1,36,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

The model demonstrates the strong relationship of project performance to a variety of PIIs including design completeness, definition of a project vision statement, testing oversight, and project manager experience and dedication. The correlational research methodology targeted 75 projects representing approximately $274.53 million in civil construction. The data collection effort considered 45 PIIs (independent variables) using quantitative and qualitative measures. The modeling technique involved the use of multiple linear regression, a method that exploits available data from multiple, independent sources to focus on specific outcomes. The model was developed directly from contractor specific information and subjected to rigorous statistical analysis. The model provides project managers as front line industry practitioners with a deliberate yet practical approach to project management and productivity enhancement.

To date, the construction sector relies either on intensive manual observations or intrusive tag-based practices. Visual tracking methods can provide automated and tag-less monitoring. However, no method to date has succeeded in tracking multiple workers, as construction sites are complex environments due to congestion, background clutter and occlusions. In addition, workers have similar appearance and exhibit illumination/scale/posture variations and abrupt changes in movement over the course of their task. To address these shortcomings, we propose a vision-based method that consists of 3 models. Firstly, an adaptive model provides continuous information about the previous position of workers and their appearance features. Secondly, a prediction model is used to calculate the current position of workers, and finally, an appearance model provides accurate localisation. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high performance and outperforms the latest relevant state of the art methods.","[Konstantinou, Eirini; Lasenby, Joan; Brilakis, Ioannis] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Trumptington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England","Konstantinou, E (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Trumptington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.",ek415@cam.ac.uk; jl221@cam.ac.uk; ib340@cam.ac.uk,"Konstantinou, Eirini/AAZ-9905-2021; Brilakis, Ioannis/H-5369-2013","Konstantinou, Eirini/0000-0003-3652-5557; Brilakis, Ioannis/0000-0003-1829-2083",EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [13440016]; LAING O'ROURKE PLC [13440016],"This research is an ICASE studentship award, supported by EPSRC and LAING O'ROURKE PLC under Grant No. 13440016.

The current behavior-based safety (BBS) practices in construction do not sufficiently take management behavior into consideration, which leads to superficial and nonpersistent intervention impacts on unsafe behavior. In academia, the relationship between management behavior and employees' individual behavior in construction has not been clearly studied and precisely depicted. This paper is aimed at discovering those management behaviors which can significantly impact worker safety behavior in construction projects and depict the exact impacting paths. Supervisors were on the focus because they interact with workers most profoundly and frequently among all levels of the management. Two dimensions of supervisory behavior were identified, namely (1) training and preventive action, and (2) reactive and supportive action. Group-level safety climate was used as the mediator along the influencing paths. A 3-month strictly controlled questionnaire survey was undertaken in the Hong Kong construction industry to collect empirical data. Results obtained from confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling showed that both direct and indirect impacts of supervisory behavior on worker safety behavior exist. Reactive and supportive action has a direct impact on worker safety behavior, but no impact on safety climate. Training and preventive action can influence different aspects of safety climate of the construction sites (like supervisory environment and workers' involvement), and thus improve safety conditions in a more profound (and comprehensive) manner than reactive and supportive action. This paper establishes the detailed empirical links among operational management behavior, group-level safety climate, and worker safety behavior in the construction settings, which can give significant insights into the development of safety management theories and practices. This can further help practitioners design enhanced BBS intervention approaches which can have a more sustainable and persistent impact on worker safety behavior. Specific recommendations and suggestions are provided for future BBS practices in construction.

We examined whether construction workers predominantly identify themselves in terms of their workgroup or in terms of the construction site. In addition, we examined the associations between social identity and safety climate, and how these constructs are associated with work-related accidents. The analyses were based on questionnaire responses from 478 construction workers from two large construction sites, and the methods involved structural equation modeling. Results showed that the workers identified themselves primarily with their workgroup, and to a lesser degree with the construction site. Social identity and safety climate were related both at the workgroup and construction site levels, meaning that social identity may be an antecedent for safety climate. The association between social identity and safety climate was stronger at the workgroup level than at the construction site level. Finally, safety climate at both levels was inversely associated with self-reported accidents, with the strongest association at the workgroup level. A focus on improving safety climate, particularly by integrating initiatives at both the workgroup and management level, may have the potential to improve safety performance and thus decrease the risk of accidents and injuries on construction sites.","[Andersen, Lars Peter; Nordam, Line; Nielsen, Kent J.] Reg Hosp Herning, Dept Occupat Med, Herning, Denmark; [Joensson, Thomas] Aarhus Univ, Dept Psychol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Kines, Pete] Natl Res Ctr Working Environm, Div Safety Res, Copenhagen, Denmark","Andersen, LP (corresponding author), Reg Hosp Herning, Dept Occupat Med, Herning, Denmark.",laande@rm.dk,,"Jonsson, Thomas/0000-0002-9161-4459; Nielsen, Kent/0000-0002-4643-5697; Kines, Pete/0000-0002-8660-6366",Danish Working Environment Research Fund [26-2013-03],This work was supported by Danish Working Environment Research Fund [project number 26-2013-03].,,53,18,18,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

It is common for migrant workers/ethnic minorities (EMs) who are already part of the society to join the construction industry. With increasing involvement of EMs in the construction industry, effective strategies for improving their safety and health are urgently needed. The existing body of knowledge is mainly derived from research conducted in English-speaking countries with Western cultures. Research on safety of migrant/EM construction workers in multidialect Asian countries with Eastern cultures has been lacking. This study aimed to identify various strategies for improving the safety and health of EM construction workers from the Asian perspective. Twenty-two face-to-face semistructured interviews were performed with safety professionals in Hong Kong followed by two rounds of Delphi survey with 18 safety experts to verify the interview findings and rank the relative importance of the strategies. The study unveiled 14 strategies for improving the safety performance of EM workers. The three most important ones identified were (1)to provide safety training in EM native languages, (2)that government and industry associations should play an active role in promoting health and safety awareness of EM workers, and (3)to encourage EM workers to learn the local language. This study contributes to filling the research gap by evaluating the strategies for improving safety of migrant/EM construction workers in Asian countries with Eastern cultures in which English is not the first language. Research findings would assist occupational health and safety experts and relevant stakeholders in designing strategies for improving the safety and health of EM workers, which will ultimately improve overall safety performance of the construction industry.","[Chan, Albert P.

These injuries and deaths do not only bring suffering to the workers and their families, but also incur delays and costs to the projects. Therefore, safety is an important issue that a general contractor must monitor and control. One of the fundamental safety regulations is wearing a hardhat, which should not be violated anytime on the sites. In this paper, a novel vision-based method is proposed to automate the monitoring of whether people are wearing hardhats on the construction sites. Under the method, human bodies and hardhats are first detected in the video frames captured by on-site construction cameras. Then, the matching between the detected human bodies and hardhats is performed using their geometric and spatial relationship. This way, the people who are not wearing hardhats could be automatically identified and safety alerts could be issued correspondingly. The method has been tested with real site videos. The high safety alert precision and recall of the method demonstrate its potential to facilitate the site safety monitoring work.

Such individuals might behave unsafely because they assign low priority to safety. Some evidence in the literature suggests that people's personalities could influence their safety behavior at work. However, it seems that the correlation between construction workers' personality traits and safety behavior has been insufficiently addressed in the existing literature. This paper attempts to provide evidence on this issue. Two hundred and eighty workers were surveyed to gather data concerning personality traits and safety behavior. The results indicated that across the set of Big Five personality traits, conscientiousness revealed the strongest correlation with workers' safety behavior, followed by extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. In addition, agreeableness and conscientiousness were found to be positively correlated with workers' safety behavior whereas extraversion and neuroticism were negatively correlated with workers' safety behavior. These findings seem to imply practical implications. For example, some tasks, such as operating construction machinery, require focused attention and stable emotions, which may not be suitable for people who score high in neuroticism. Site managers may take into consideration the personality traits of an individual when selecting personnel and allocating tasks.","[Gao, Yifan; Gonzalez, Vicente A.] Univ Auckland, Fac Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Yiu, Tak Wing] Massey Univ, Sch Built Environm, Auckland 0632, New Zealand","Gao, YF (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Fac Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",ygao516@aucklanduni.ac.nz; tyiu@massey.ac.nz,"Yiu, A/Prof. Tak Wing/A-3334-2009","Yiu, A/Prof. Tak Wing/0000-0002-8466-7130",,,,116,13,13,16,67,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Due to its capability to build several regression models by adding independent variables to previous models, moderated hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to identify the underlying effect of resource allocation on the project complexity and performance relationship. The results show that: (i) project complexity was significantly correlated with schedule growth (positive correlation) but not significantly correlated with cost growth; (ii) resource allocation was significantly correlated with schedule growth (negative correlation) but not with cost growth; and (iii) resource allocation had a buffering effect where increasing resource allocation significantly decreases the effect of project complexity on schedule growth. The findings from this study contribute to the extant literature on construction project complexity by empirically showing that the impact of project complexity on schedule performance interacts with the level of resource allocation. This understanding of the role of resource allocation may help construction managers and engineers to better administer and manage their complex transportation projects. The findings also imply that organizations should appropriately evaluate project complexity to allocate necessary resources to achieve project success.","[Nguyen, Long D.] Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Dept Environm & Civil Engn, 10501 FGCU Blvd S, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USA; [Long Le-Hoai] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Tran, Dai Q.] Univ Kansas, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Dang, Chau N.] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Nguyen, Chau V.] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang, Vietnam","Nguyen, LD (corresponding author), Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Dept Environm & Civil Engn, 10501 FGCU Blvd S, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USA.",lnguyen@fgcu.edu,"Dang, Chau Ngoc/AAC-5426-2019; Dang, Chau/AAZ-8208-2020; Le-Hoai, Long/AAW-1802-2020","Dang, Chau/0000-0002-4740-6986; LE-HOAI, LONG/0000-0003-4940-8560",,,,83,17,17,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

In light of the inaccuracy of the tracking system, buffer areas are defined as statistical zones, at some distance from potential workplace hazards. Statistical alerts are created according to predefined rules when the hazard exposure of workers in those zones crosses a certain threshold. The results of tests of the method demonstrate that the model is able to successfully process the location data in order to compensate for its inaccuracy. This is done without necessitating a significant increase in the areas that are defined as being of high risk, and therefore off-limits for most workers on site. The model can thus ensure the efficiency of the construction work by restricting the size of the areas on site that are off-limits for most workers, while at the same time ensuring the safety of workers. The method can also ensure that alerts will not be ignored by using statistical rules to avoid an excessive number of alerts, and by discerning who should be the client of an alert.","[Edrei, Tsah] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Unit Management & Safety Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Isaac, Shabtai] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Struct Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Isaac, S (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Struct Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",isaacsh@bgu.ac.il,"SHABTAI, IZAAC/ABB-6354-2020","Isaac, Shabtai/0000-0001-8601-7601",,,,23,6,6,1,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

To address good indoor environment quality (IEQ), strategic and practical design decisions are needed in the early phase of the building process to ensure successful implementation. However, current procurement practices are hampered by fragmentation, long subcontract chains and vague performance requirements. A preliminary study is undertaken that focuses on developing a method of contracting that enables the attainment and verification of the desired IEQ. Using a review of international research and practices, existing commissioning methods and contract procedures are identified for their attention to IEQ. A contract procedure is proposed that fosters agreement on indoor environment between building owners and tenants, and which directs a building project to give users the guarantee of indoor condition. To make a pre-lease contract agreement that includes IEQ, the factors having an influence on the IEQ chain must be included in all building contracts such as those of design, purchase, and operation and maintenance. Thus, the requirements of IEQ require their incorporation into every phase of the building project. The main elements in these contracts, in addition to the requirements of IEQ, are those verifying quality, bonuses and sanctions.","Helsinki Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Lab Construct Econ & Management, FIN-02015 Helsinki, Finland","Saari, A (corresponding author), Helsinki Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Lab Construct Econ & Management, POB 2100, FIN-02015 Helsinki, Finland.",arto.saari@ttk.fi,"Saari, Arto/D-1888-2012","Saari, Arto/0000-0001-5205-712X",,,,24,4,4,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

A simulation model was developed to determine the impact of schedule variability on cost estimation. To generate random scenarios a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) technique was applied. The developed model computes the cost impact of delayed milestone in the expected budget. Using a risk integration approach revealed the critical time frame that may lead to a budget deficit for a project. As a result, a number of cost-sensitive risk factors and schedule delays were identified for the critical time period where the risk of budget deficit increases. The method of integration proposed in this article highlights the priority of risk factors and schedule delays for construction contracts involving Payments at Event Occurrences (PEO). Consequently, the developed method can be useful for practitioners in anticipation of potential increase of costs, hence, prevention of failure due to budget deficit.","[Pehlivan, Salahi] Girne Amer Univ, Ind Engn Dept, Kyrenia, Turkey; [Oztemir, Ali Erhan] Cyprus Int Univ, Construct Management Civil Engn Dept, Nicosia, Cyprus","Pehlivan, S (corresponding author), Girne Amer Univ, Fac Engn, Ind Engn Dept, Girne 10, North Cyprus, Turkey.",salahipehlivan@gau.edu.tr,,,,,,16,9,9,3,38,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1042-9247,2377-0643,,ENG MANAG J,EMJ-Eng.

In an attempt to overcome such limitations, a new CEAC methodology is proposed based on a modified index-based formula predicting expected cost for the remaining work with the Gompertz growth model via nonlinear regression curve fitting. Moreover, the proposed equation accounts for the schedule progress as a factor of cost performance. To this end, it integrates into its equation an Earned Schedule-based factor indicating expected duration at completion. The proposed model shows itself to be more accurate and precise in all early, middle, and late stage estimates than those of four compared traditional index-based formulae. The developed methodology is a practical tool for Project Managers to better incorporate the progress status into the task of computing CEAC and is a contribution to extending EVM research to better capture the inherent relation between cost and schedule factors.

To protect the best interest of contracting firms, subcontractors should be carefully selected. Previous studies have been focusing on the factors leading to the success of subcontracting work without paying much attention to those factors contributing to the organizational success. To gain a better insight on the success factors for subcontracting organizations, a survey which focuses on equipment-intensive subcontractors has been conducted in Hong Kong with various construction stakeholders. Acknowledging that equipment-intensive subcontractors may have their peculiar needs and characteristics, this paper strives to explore the critical success factors (CSFs) for this type of subcontractors. Seventeen CSFs for equipment-intensive subcontractors have been identified, and the results indicate that majority of them are internal factors. A one-way ANOVA test has been carried out, which confirms the consistency in perceptions of different construction stakeholders surveyed. Through a factor analysis the CSFs are grouped into six major components namely: (i) market position; (ii) equipment-related factors; (iii) human resources; (iv) earnings; (v) managerial ability to adapt to changes; and (vi) project success related factors. The findings of this research should not only help subcontractors to improve their performance but also to assist main contractor to identify a successful equipment-intensive subcontracting firm.

BIM is capable to store huge amounts of information related to buildings which can be leveraged in several areas such as quantity takeoff, scheduling, sustainability and facility management. The main objective of this research is to establish a model for automated schedule generation using BIM and to solve the time-cost trade-off problem (TCTP) resulting from the various scenarios offered to the user. Design/methodology/approach A model is developed to use the quantities exported from a BIM platform, then generate construction activities, calculate the duration of each activity and finally the logic/sequence is applied in order to link the activities together. Then, multiobjective optimization is performed using nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) in order to provide the most feasible solutions considering project duration and cost. The researchers opted NSGA-II because it is one of the well-known and credible algorithms that have been used in many applications, and its performances were tested in several comparative studies. Findings The proposed model is capable to select the near-optimum scenario for the project and export it to Primavera software. A case study is worked to demonstrate the use of the proposed model and illustrate its main features. Originality/value The proposed model can provide a simple and user-friendly model for automated schedule generation of construction projects. In addition, opportunities related to the interface between an automated schedule generation model and Primavera software are enabled as Primavera is one of the most popular and common schedule software solutions in the construction industry. Furthermore, it allows importing data from MS Excel, which is used to store activities data in the different scenarios. In addition, there are numerous solutions, each one corresponds to a certain duration and cost according to the performance factor which often reflects the number of crews assigned to the activity and/or construction method.","[ElMenshawy, Mohamed; Marzouk, Mohamed] Cairo Univ, Cairo, Egypt","Marzouk, M (corresponding author), Cairo Univ, Cairo, Egypt.",elmenshawy.mohamed@gmail.com; mmarzouk@cu.edu.eg,,,,,,44,2,2,7,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Project planners face complicated multivariate time-cost optimization problems that require simultaneous minimization of total project duration and total project cost while considering issues related to the optimal present value of profit. In addition, given the complexity of construction projects in recent years, clever management has become increasingly important in cases of project financing and scheduling. There are choices and limits that make it difficult for project planners to develop a proper financing plan considering project time status. Therefore, the methods of financing affect the project plan. Parameters such as interest rate, contract terms, and financing options (i.e., types of the loan) in the project construction period can change the final profit value of the project. Hence, a skilled planner should consider various effective parameters for scheduling projects. This study presents a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm to solve a multi-objective optimization problem in construction project planning and financing. The main objective of the model is to present a Pareto chart that shows the trade-off between duration of the project and the financing cost by considering different durations for each activity of the project and various financing options. The model is first validated in a simple case study and then applied to a large-scale case study. The model shows the optimal solutions which have time and financing cost. For each optimal solution, the model will create a cash flow containing project (direct and indirect cost and payments) and financing flows (borrowed money and repayments of principal and interest) based on a work schedule. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the effects of changes in the various parameters of the project cash flow on the ultimate results. It is shown that the proposed model is superior to the existing models in finding better project planning solutions with lower total project duration and lower total project financing cost in the proposed construction project financing problems. In addition, the proposed model improves the solutions through generations and provides optimal solutions in acceptable processing time.","[Tavakolan, Mehdi; Nikoukar, Shayan] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Tehran, Iran","Tavakolan, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Tehran, Iran.",mtavakolan@ut.ac.ir,,,,,,57,2,2,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

This situation can lead to misinterpretation of the project status, especially under a multiproject management environment. It is also a daunting task for the inexperienced engineers to formulate and monitor the project-specific work packages.

In order to address this issue, this study proposes the concept of standard progress measurement package. Issues for standardization of the work breakdown structure that can embody distinct characteristics of different construction projects are investigated.

Past literature has established theoretical relationships between construction safety and quality on the basis of opinions of industry experts. This is the first empirical inquiry into the relationship between safety and quality, testing the null hypothesis that there is no statistical relationship among quality performance indicators and safety performance indicators. To test this hypothesis, empirical data were collected from 32 building construction projects, ranging in scope from $50,000 to $300million dollars. Several quality metrics (e.g.,cost of rework per $1M project scope and rate of rework per 200,000 worker-hours) were used as predictor variables and first aid and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable injury rates were used as response variables. Linear regressions among the predictor and response variables showed that there are two statistically significant relationships: the OSHA recordable injury rate is positively correlated to rework (r2=0.968; p-value=0.032) and the first aid rate is positively correlated to number of defects (r2=0.548; p-value=0.009). To understand why these relationships exist and to identify specific strategies that promote both safety and quality, open-ended interviews were conducted with project managers. These individuals indicated that the most compelling reason for the strong positive correlation between rework and injuries is the fact that rework involves demolition, schedule pressure, and unstable work processes. They also noted that devoting resources to preplanning, allowing the necessary time to complete tasks correctly the first time, encouraging leadership at the workface, and encouraging workers to take pride in their work are all strategies that promote both safety and quality.","[Wanberg, John; Harper, Christofer; Hallowell, Matthew R.] Univ Colorado, Construct Engn & Management Program, Dept Civil Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Rajendran, Sathyanarayanan] Cent Washington Univ, Safety & Hlth Management Program, Dept Engn Technol Safety & Construct, Ellensburg, WA 98926 USA","Wanberg, J (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Construct Engn & Management Program, Dept Civil Engn, 1111 Engn Dr,428 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",John.S.Wanberg@colorado.edu; christofer.harper@colorado.edu; matthew.hallowell@colorado.edu; rajendrans@cwu.edu,"Harper, Christofer/AAN-5243-2020; Hallowell, Matthew R/G-7918-2016",,,,,44,71,72,2,109,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The article presents analysis results of the main criteria considered by Polish public clients in contractor competence evaluation. Research was carried out on the basis of demands stated by clients in restricted tenders announced in 2007. The author also presents research results of the methods and criteria for construction contractor selection, used by Polish private clients. To carry out the research a questionnaire was sent to 27 private clients at the turn of 2006/2007. The results of the research show that public clients in most of the restricted tenders use just one of the criteria used to qualify a candidate to the second stage of tender procedure and it is usually the contractor's experience. Generally, it is characterised by the number of realised projects similar to the ordered one. For private clients, in contractor competence evaluation, technical possibilities of a contractor are especially valued.

Numerous methods have been developed to take conjoint data and produce optimal or near-optimal product designs. But conjoint analysis, while significantly contributing to the product design process, still has the limitation of designing a product based only on input from the consumer. Under certain circumstances, designer preferences are an important source of expertise that needs to supplement consumer preferences in the product design problem, This research proposes a unique way of designing products using the distinct and parallel opinions from both the consumer and the designer, a concept we call designer-moderated product design. This paper 1) makes a case for using designer as well as consumer preferences; 2) formulates a share-of-choices model for designer-moderated product designs; 3) develops and evaluates a heuristic to solve the problem using genetic algorithm techniques; and 3) presents a real application of the model and the heuristic.","Univ Massachusetts, Coll Management, Boston, MA 02125 USA; Univ Connecticut, Operat & Informat Management Dept, Sch Business, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Tarasewich, P (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Coll Management, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",,,,,,,32,27,27,0,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394 USA",0018-9391,,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Previous studies have identified various indicators for assessing contractor competitiveness, and several assessment methods have been introduced. Nevertheless, these studies are limited because they are unable to tell which indicators are more important in different market environments. This paper identifies the key competitiveness indicators (KCIs) for assessing contractor competitiveness in the Chinese construction market. An index value is used to indicate the relative significance of various competitiveness indicators based on which KCIs are identified. The data applied in this study are from a survey of the construction industry in mainland China. The research findings provide valuable information for both existing businesses and the construction professionals who plan to compete for construction works in the Chinese market. The study provides useful references for further studies that compare the KCIs used in the Chinese construction industry and those used in other construction industries.","Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Chongqing Univ, Fac Construct Management & Real Estate, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Shen, LY (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bsshen@polyu.edu.hk; 03901575r@polyu.edu.hk; bsmyam@polyu.edu.hk,"yam, michael/L-8215-2019; Lu, Wilson/E-2899-2010","yam, michael/0000-0002-4519-9397; Lu, Wilson/0000-0003-4674-0357; Shen, Liyin/0000-0002-0163-4377",,,,20,52,54,0,16,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

This paper explores a method for mitigating the negative effects associated with contractors' claims and disputes using a risk retention approach. This method can help contractors in getting early relief from the financial and economic burdens of construction claims. To meet the goals and objectives of this study, the writers have: (1) investigated the feasibility of pricing insurance premiums using the options pricing theory; (2) explored the applicability of modeling the options pricing theory using Monte Carlo simulation; (3) set up the principles required for optimal design of a risk retention group for construction claims; and (4) tested the possible impact of the newly developed risk retention group using historic data of 10,193 construction projects spanning over 12 different California districts. Pursuant to this study, it was verified that construction claims satisfy the required principles for insurance. Also, based on the used testing framework, the developed risk retention group for construction claims has been proved a success from the insured and insurer sides. It is the writers' hope that this study will lay the basis for a leading risk management technique that could be extended over the nation for the benefit of relieving the negative consequences associated with lengthy claims and disputes resolution in the construction industry.","[Kandil, Amr A.] Purdue Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct Engn & Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [El-adaway, Islam H.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Bldg Construct Sci, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA","Kandil, AA (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct Engn & Management, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ie15@msstate.edu; akandil@purdue.edu,"Kandil, Amr/AAQ-3902-2021; El-adaway, Islam/K-4394-2015","El-adaway, Islam/0000-0002-7306-6380",National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF-CMMI-0700363],"This work would have never been completed without the sincere and genuine guidance provided by Dr. Dermot Hayes, Pioneer Chair, Professor of Economics, and Professor of Finance at Iowa State University as well as by Dr. Mark Power, University Professor, Principal Financial Group Finance Fellow, and Professor of Finance at Iowa State University.

However, there is still a need to integrate the quality and safety together in time-cost trade-off optimization. To fill this gap, considering the multimode activities in project, this paper presents a multimode resource-constrained time-cost-quality-safety trade-off optimization model. Besides, this study considered the limited availability of resources for each execution mode of activities. A population-based meta-heuristics approach the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA III) is employed to develop the model. Also, Latin hypercube sampling for population initialization, analytical hierarchy process for quality determination and fuzzy logic for safety parameters determination are used. A case study of building construction project is used to demonstrate the applicability of proposed model. Whereas, the measure of various performance metrics and comparisons with existing trade-off optimization models demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed model in simultaneous optimization of four objectives. Moreover, a value path plot is prepared for the visualization of more than three objectives and a priori approach is presented to select one solution from obtained Pareto-optimal front.","[Sharma, Kamal; Trivedi, Manoj Kumar] Madhav Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India","Sharma, K (corresponding author), Madhav Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India.",kamalsharma211196@gmail.com,"Sharma, Kamal/AAP-8583-2021",,,,,49,1,1,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

However, discussion is ongoing as to what is the optimal incentive arrangement. This paper derives an optimal incentive contract for a risk-neutral contractor; the owner may be either risk averse or risk neutral. An incentive is established based on a sharing of a project's equivalent monetary outcome (expressed relative to a benchmark or target that is desired by the owner), while aligning the contractor's interests with those of the owner. The derivation is based on solving an optimization problem. The paper shows that at the optimum and expressed relative to the target, any favorable or adverse outcome associated with both the contractor's effort and events beyond the contractor's influence should, respectively, be wholly received by or wholly borne by a risk-neutral contractor. Practitioners were interviewed to validate this result. This paper gives an original solution to the optimal sharing problem in incentive construction contracts, contributing to current practices in contracts management. The solution follows an ordered argument and is usable by practitioners. Additionally, this paper extends agency theory on risk-averse principals. This paper will be of interest to academics and practitioners concerned with the design of incentive contracts. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","[Hosseinian, S.

Design/methodology/approach The findings in this paper are based on data collected from 12 diverse projects from five different business sectors executed in Norway by means of an online, closed-question questionnaire, which was analyzed using various statistical approaches. Findings Stakeholder dynamics is a contextual phenomenon, which takes different forms and shapes from one stakeholder group to the other, from one industry or business sector to the other, and even from one project to the other within the same industry or business sector. The stakeholder group of user(s) was the most dynamic in Norwegian projects based on their continuous repositioning on the power/interest matrix from one project phase to the other. Environmental activists/organizations were the least dynamic stakeholder group in the full sample of projects. Originality/value This paper presents the first more comprehensive empirically based findings about stakeholder dynamics in projects the authors have been able to find. The study gives project management practitioners insights from various industries and business sectors into how stakeholders change position over time. It also shows that the two attributes of power and interest are strongly connected and affect one another, which might make it possible to control and design a safer and less complex stakeholder environment for future projects.","[ElWakeel, Omar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, Trondheim, Norway; [Andersen, Bjorn] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Trondheim, Norway","ElWakeel, O (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, Trondheim, Norway.",omar.k.elwakeel@gmail.com,,,,,,43,0,0,5,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

The workers' safety-related behaviors are subject to a variety of factors, such as interactions with coworkers and interventions by management teams. The impacts of these factors have attracted considerable attention in academia but are yet to be fully examined. To provide a quantitative assessment of these impacts and their managerial implications in practice, an agent-based modeling approach of construction safety-related behaviors, which adopts a bottom-up architecture, is proposed in this research. This approach regards safety performance as an emergent property of the behaviors and interactions of construction workers and management teams. The development of the agent-based model is based on a range of theoretical and empirical evidence, including a cognitive analysis model for modeling worker behaviors, and site observations and surveys for the design of simulated working environment and tasks, as well as the modeling of individual behaviors and interactions. Four managerial scenarios are simulated using the proposed approach. Based on the simulation results, the effects of a number of managerial factors on the safety performance of construction workers are examined. These factors include duties of supervisors, the competency and inspection strategy of safety officers, the frequency of safety training, senior managers' involvement in safety activities and emphasis on safety goals. The effects of these factors are examined in a quantitative manner, and relevant implications for construction safety management practice are discussed. The findings prove that agent-based modeling is an effective approach for analyzing the characteristics and patterns of construction safety-related behaviors and assessing possible safety management strategies.","[Zhang, Peiyao; Li, Nan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhongming] Natl Dev & Reform Commiss, Inst Comprehens Transportat, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Fang, Dongping] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Anumba, Chimay J.] Univ Florida, Coll Design Construct & Planning, POB 32611-5701, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Fang, DP (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",zhangpy14@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; nanli@tsinghua.edu.cn; fangdp@tsinghua.edu.cn; anumba@dcp.ufl.edu,"Li, Nan/W-4397-2017","Li, Nan/0000-0002-7272-4273","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0802001]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71572088, 51378296]; Tsinghua University-Glodon Joint Research Centre for Building Information Model (RCBIM); Gammon Construction Ltd.","This research was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0802001), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71572088 and 51378296), Gammon Construction Ltd., and the Tsinghua University-Glodon Joint Research Centre for Building Information Model (RCBIM) for their support.",,89,33,36,24,139,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Construction clients are becoming more aware of the fact that selection of a contractor based on tender price alone is quite risky and may lead to the failure of the project in terms of time delay and poor quality standards. Evaluation of contractors based on multiple criteria is, therefore, becoming more popular. Contractor selection in a multicriteria environment is, in essence, largely dependent on the uncertainty inherent in the nature of construction projects and subjective judgment of decision makers (DMs). This paper presents a systematic procedure based on fuzzy set theory to evaluate the capability of a contractor to deliver the project as per the owner's requirements. The notion of Shapley value is used to determine the global value or relative importance of each criterion in accomplishing the overall objective of the decision-making process. The research reported upon forms part of a larger study that aims to develop a fuzzy decision model for construction contractor selection involving investigating multiple criteria selection tendencies of construction clients, relationship among decision criteria, and construction clients' preferences of criteria in the contractor selection process. An illustration with a bid evaluation exercise is presented to demonstrate the data requirements and the application of the method in selecting the most appropriate contractor for the project under uncertainty. The proposed model is not intended to supplant the work of decision-making teams in the contractor selection process, but rather to help them make quality evaluations of the available candidate contractors.

Selecting the right contractor for the right project is the most crucial challenge for any construction client. Numerous and often conflicting objectives and alternatives, such as tender price, completion date, and experience, need to be considered. Recently, to assist owners in making decisions, there has been a trend away from a lowest-price wins principle and subjective judgement to a multicriteria selection approach in the selection of contractors for construction projects. In the autonomous region of Cantabria, in the north of Spain, increased project complexity and higher requirements have recently demanded the use of multicriteria decision-making methods for contractor selection. With this aim, two multicriteria decision methods, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and vlsekriterijumska optimizacija I kompromisno resenje (VIKOR) methods, are applied to the selection of a contractor for the road building project La Braguia undertaken during 2002. The results show that one of the contractors is the highest ranked by both methods. Being the highest ranked alternative by the TOPSIS method indicates that this contractor is the best in terms of the ranking index. In addition, being the highest ranked alternative by the VIKOR method indicates that it is the closest to the ideal solution. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000488.

However, in the international construction arena, quantity surveyors have renowned construction competencies and are widely involved in construction projects. They have different names in different countries e.g. cost engineer, building economist, cost manager, or construction accountant. In spite of the different names, they have significant skills that have evolved to meet the increasing and changing needs of clients, especially in the international construction arena. This research investigated the roles of quantity surveyors and the complexities they may find in international construction. A literature review and survey questionnaire were used to investigate the roles, complexities, and the level of competition from other construction professionals. The results showed that quantity surveyors had many roles in construction, with a majority of them acting as representatives of clients in construction projects. Also, they experienced varied complexities and faced competition from other construction professionals. It is noteworthy that they had procedures to safeguard the survival of the profession and had room for future expansion and diversification of their roles in international construction. The research provides useful information for those professionals and clients wishing to take part in international construction.","[Wao, Joel Ochieng] Tuskegee Univ, Dept Construct Sci & Management, Tuskegee, AL 36088 USA; [Flood, Ian] Univ Florida, ME Rinker Sr Sch Construct Management, Gainesville, FL USA","Wao, JO (corresponding author), Tuskegee Univ, Dept Construct Sci & Management, Tuskegee, AL 36088 USA.",jamapira@gmail.com,"Wao, Joel/AAH-7039-2020",,,,,25,7,7,5,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

The purpose of this paper is to describe and explain how public owners use multiple criteria for the award of construction contracts. It is likely that nonprice criteria support the alignment of owner and contractor interests, and that bidder behavior should be affected by the likelihood of repeated contracts, and by the transparency of owners' evaluation procedures. Data from 386 bidding documents reflecting practice in Swedish municipalities in 2003 are analyzed. A typical pattern is a 70% price weight combined with three nonprice criteria. Price formulas, translating bid prices into scale values, were found to be based on the lowest bid, bid spread, or average bid. Nonprice criteria were evaluated on either relative or absolute merits. Owners should be aware of the incentives that their selection practices create and view this in a policy perspective, whereas contractors should be ready to assess the short and long term values of nonprice features.","Chalmers, Dept Technol Management & Econ, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden","Waara, F (corresponding author), Chalmers, Dept Technol Management & Econ, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",fredrik.waara@chalmers.se; jan.brochner@chalmers.se,"Brochner, Jan/E-4825-2018","Brochner, Jan/0000-0002-1961-0330",,,,37,65,65,0,19,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Because of different social and economic systems, as well as different historical and cultural backgrounds, contractors are likely to encounter different risks in different markets. Based on questionnaires and case studies, this paper adopts an importance evaluation index and makes an importance evaluation of various risks encountered by Chinese contractors when contracting for projects in Chinese markets. This paper also makes comparisons between and analyses of the research findings and related available investigation results. The Cox-Stuart trend increase test method is applied in the current research, the results indicating that the variance corresponding to the importance index value tends to increase as the risk event importance decreases. This tendency shows that those investigated tend towards unanimity in terms of higher importance risk events. This paper also examines the reliability of the questionnaires by means of Cronbach's Alpha Coefficient. The research shows that the main risk currently encountered by Chinese contractors in domestic markets includes owner's irregular behavior and government departments' interference in construction markets. China's accession to the WTO has provided greater opportunities for international contractors to enter the Chinese construction market. Therefore the research results described in this paper can provide valuable data enabling international contractors to gain a better understanding of the potential risks in the environment of the Chinese construction market.","Tsinghua Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; Univ British Columbia, Dept Civil Engn, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Fang, DP (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",,"Chen, Zhen/C-1587-2010; Fong, Patrick S.W./O-7315-2014","Chen, Zhen/0000-0003-0212-1140; Fong, Patrick S.W./0000-0002-2017-5698; Shen, Liyin/0000-0002-0163-4377",,,,17,84,87,2,47,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Due to the perceived benefits shortfall of MPIC, well organized actions from 'secondary stakeholder' groups have led to delays, cost overruns, and significant damage to the organization's reputation. Stakeholder management is an essential process which aims to maximize positive inputs and minimize detrimental attitudes by taking into account the needs and requirements of all project stakeholders. However, current project stakeholder management mechanisms are reactive rather than proactive, mainly offering an instrumental perspective, which aims to make the stakeholders comply with project needs. Therefore, a broader inclusiveness of secondary stakeholders who could be harmed by the organization's strategy, such as the local communities, is required to enhance the performance of MPIC.

Using data from the automotive industry, we study the relationship between unit cost and economies of scale, experience curve effects, and imputed cost of quality in a specific context. Estimating these effects on unit cost explicitly has been problematic either due to unavailability of data or the imprecision of available data. Further, if a firm wishes to benchmark itself against its principal competitors along these cost dimensions, unavailability of data on competitors renders estimation impossible. In this paper, we propose and illustrate a method based on the iterative optimization of a dynamic model that has been presented in the literature. The results for a specific, illustrative case confirm the anticipated effects of experience curve advantages and economies of scale, lending validity to the proposed methodology. The results show that there is a positive relationship between unit cost and quality improvements; this possibility has also been raised by other researchers in the literature. The use of the methodology and implications for managerial use are discussed.","Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Michigan State Univ, Eli Broad Grad Sch Management, Dept Mkt & Supply Chain Management, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Mendez, D (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,34,8,9,0,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394 USA",0018-9391,,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

It is an approach that links the design and construction processes. The studies in the Unites States, United Kingdom, and Australia have demonstrated that improved constructability has lead to significant savings in both cost and time required for completing construction projects. However, in implementing constructability improvement, it is important to consider the uniqueness of the construction industry in a specific country.

Understanding the factors influencing the cost of quality (COQ) in the procurement process could help identify opportunities for lowering quality cost without compromising quality. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, a COQ model for the construction material procurement process is developed using the traditional prevention-appraisal-failure (PAF) approach. Using data from a $4bn aluminum smelter construction project, the authors conducted a simulation of the COQ model to evaluate various quality assurance policies. Findings This paper confirms that raising the prevention cost leads to a drop in failure cost as well as COQ for the project studied. While the authors are unable to provide blanket recommendations as the results are derived from a single project case study, it does suggest that construction material procurement processes would benefit from a higher prevention expenditure. And for certain cases where the authors observe a deviation from the traditional Juran's model of COQ - the high appraisal cost in the procurement process - reduction of appraisal expenditure may in fact be more beneficial than its increase. Originality/value The research results suggest that appraisal expenditure should be tailored to each purchase order in order to maximize the total benefits. Additionally, this paper presents the first COQ model developed for the construction material procurement process. Another unique feature of the model is its inclusion of supplier-side costs, which are excluded in the conventional COQ analysis.","[Sawan, Rema] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Low, Jwen Fai; Schiffauerova, Andrea] Masdar Inst Sci & Technol, Masdar City, U Arab Emirates","Low, JF (corresponding author), Masdar Inst Sci & Technol, Masdar City, U Arab Emirates.",rema.sawan@gmail.com; jwenfai@gmail.com; aschiffauerova@masdar.ac.ae,,,,,,33,8,8,4,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Hispanic construction workers, an at-risk population with high rates of workplace accidents, are affected by that divide because they rarely take advantage of available ICTs at work. One application of ICTs that can help Hispanic/Latino workers is computer-based training (CBT) for occupational safety. However, the design of CBT materials for Spanish-speaking workers needs to go beyond basic localization of existing products in English. A radical localization approach that uses participatory design sessions with construction workers and their supervisors is proposed in this paper. This case study reports that Latino workers reacted positively and retained knowledge from CBT materials, including videos with elements of humor and without graphic representations of accidents, modeled after the genre of a television situation comedy.

This paper addresses design-change issues during the preliminary design phase and leverages end-user satisfaction through the use of collaborative functions in a VR environment for material cost estimation. In this regard, the research proposes a VR-based framework for interior finish material selection, incorporating both visual aesthetics and associated cost impacts. A systematic approach for converting building information models into interactive VR models is presented. The output of this system is validated in a case study where through an interactive and immersive environment, stakeholders can interact with the three-dimensional model and visually receive an updated cost estimate in real time. The proposed approach can effectively assist different stakeholders in selecting their desired interior finish materials and change orders.

Although integrated project delivery (IPD) is known to be an ideal contractual method for BIM projects, DBB still has been the dominant contracting method, owing to the complexity of IPD, as well as regional regulations. BIM-based design coordination under DBB can effectively reduce design errors through the value engineering process. However, in practice, the cost reduction realized under DBB is minimal because, unlike under IPD, DBB contracts do not provide incentives for subcontractors to reduce costs. This study proposes that subcontracting be divided into two phases: preconstruction and construction. Only subcontractors who meet the target costs during BIM-based design coordination in the preconstruction phase win the right to work during the construction phase. From case studies, this study finds quantitative cost reductions from this change in the preconstruction process. This study also reveals the manner in which this two-phase process impacts subcontractors' attitudes toward cost-reduction efforts. These findings contribute to maximizing the efficiency of BIM-based design coordination, which will eventually contribute to more efficient delivery of construction projects.","[Jang, Sejun] Hyundai Engn & Construct, Smart Construct Team, 75 Yolgok Ro, Seoul 03058, South Korea; [Jeong, Yeonsuk] GS Engn & Construct, Smart Construct Team, 33 Jong Ro, Seoul 03159, South Korea; [Lee, Ghang; Kang, Youngcheol] Yonsei Univ, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea","Kang, Y (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",sj.jang@hdec.co.kr; ysjeong01@gsenc.com; glee@yonsei.ac.kr; yckang@yonsei.ac.kr,,"Lee, Ghang/0000-0002-3522-2733","Architecture & Urban Development Research Program - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Korean government [18AUDP-B127891-02]; Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea [20174010201320]","This research was supported by a grant (18AUDP-B127891-02) from the Architecture & Urban Development Research Program funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Korean government and by the Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP), granted financial resources from the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea (No. 20174010201320).",,52,9,9,4,99,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Development procedures consisted of the following steps: (1)setting up the development direction, (2)designing and producing the prototypes, (3)assessing the proposed approach through mock-up tests and modifying the prototypes, and (4)verifying the proposed approach through field application at a pilot project site. Overall, the time and cost to assemble beams in the pilot project site were reduced by 3days and $1365.32, respectively. In particular, safety was improved by 82.35% compared with the conventional process. The proposed approach is expected to be a practical alternative providing improved safety of the steel beam assembly process.

This study aimed to develop and test a model to understand the mechanism of unsafe behaviors based on individual characteristics and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs. To test the hypotheses, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical regression analysis were utilized. A total of 191 workers were evaluated in five construction sites to explore the effects of each internal factor. The findings showed that the TPB constructs fully mediated the relationship between individual background characteristics and unsafe behaviors. Furthermore, the analysis of the moderating effects of the variable of habits showed that the inverse relationship between safety attitude and unsafe behaviors was stronger when there was a high level of safety habits. This study also found that safety attitude and safety habits were the best predictors for the behaviors of the workers. The findings of this study provide deeper insights for both researchers and practitioners by identifying how internal factors influence the behavior to prevent the workers' unsafe behaviors.","[Mohajeri, Mehdi; Ardeshir, Abdollah] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tehran Polytech, Tehran 1591634311, Iran; [Ardeshir, Abdollah] Univ New Haven, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Malekitabar, Hassan] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Tehran 1684813114, Iran; [Rowlinson, Steve] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Rowlinson, Steve] Bond Univ, Fac Soc & Design, Construct Project Management, Gold Coast, Qld 4226, Australia","Ardeshir, A (corresponding author), Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tehran Polytech, Tehran 1591634311, Iran.; Ardeshir, A (corresponding author), Univ New Haven, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, West Haven, CT 06516 USA.",mehdi_mohajeri@aut.ac.ir; ardeshir@aut.ac.ir; malekitabar@iust.ac.ir; steverowlinson@hku.hk,,,,,,78,0,0,5,5,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

A real-life case study of a residential renovation project is analyzed to compare the generated results by the model to those provided by two available models and three current industry practices. The outcome of this analysis confirms that the model was able to reduce the total renovation cost of the case study by 3.6%-4% compared to available models/practices.

J,"Nabi, MA; El-adaway, IH",,,,"Abdul Nabi, Mohamad; El-adaway, Islam H.",,,Understanding the Key Risks Affecting Cost and Schedule Performance of Modular Construction Projects,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BARRIERS; MANAGEMENT,"Modular construction has been documented to be superior over traditional construction methods in terms of schedule, quality, predictability, and other project objectives. However, the lack of understanding and proper management of unique modular risks have been documented to result in suboptimal performance in modular construction projects. Although many previous research efforts have focused on the barriers and drivers related to the adoption of modular construction in the industry, no previous research work has addressed the key risks impacting cost and schedule of modular construction projects. This paper fills this knowledge gap. The authors utilized a multistep research methodology. First, a survey was distributed to and answered by 48 construction professionals to examine the effects of 50 modular risk factors that were identified based on a systematic literature review in a previous study. Second, a Cronbach's alpha test was conducted to check survey validity and reliability. Finally, Kendall's concordance analysis, one-way ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to examine the agreement of responses within each as well as among the various stakeholders of modular construction projects. Results showed that the most critical factors affecting both cost and schedule of modular projects are (1) shortage of skilled and experienced laborers, (2) late design changes, (3) poor site attributes and logistics, (4) unsuitability of design for modularization, (5) contractual risks and disputes, (6) lack of adequate collaboration and coordination, (7) challenges related to tolerances and interfaces, and (8) poor construction activity sequencing. This study adds to the body of knowledge by helping practitioners to better understand the key risk factors that should be considered to enhance the performance of their modular construction projects.

Risk management is an essential and integral part of project management on virtually all construction projects. Risk analysis is one of the core components of risk management that enables professionals to quantify and analyze risks that may pose potential threats to project performance in terms of cost, quality, safety, and time. This research was conducted to identify and analyze risks associated with bridge construction in Pakistan. A questionnaire was conducted to collect data. Risks affecting bridge construction project performance were identified through interviews conducted with engineers and managers involved with various bridge projects. Cost and schedule impacts of project risks were supplemented by conducting a case study using the Monte Carlo simulation. The key findings indicate that financial risks were a major factor that affected cost and schedule objectives. The highest ranked factor identified was unavailability of funds with a relative importance index greater than 85. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation were compared to the actual completion times and costs of activities in the case study. In all cases of this comparison, the actual completion date and costs fell within the predicted distribution of the Monte Carlo simulation, indicating that risk analysis can help project managers to manage cost and schedule risks. Additionally, this study provided risk analysis guidelines, which were unclear. The results of this paper can help engineers, cost control managers, and project managers evaluate particular risks on their projects and avoid delays and cost overruns.

The process of prequalification involves a large number of contractors, each being represented by many attributes. A neural network model was applied to aid in the prequalification process by classifying contractors into groups based on similarity in performance using the financial ratios of liquidity, activity, profitability, and leverage. Contractors are represented in this model by patterns in four-dimensional space. Patterns of similar performance tend to form clusters intercepting regions of low pattern density in between. A neuron with weights is used as a classifier to set a decision boundary between clusters. The method basically iterates the neuron weights to move the decision boundary to a place of low pattern density. Then, the statistical hypothesis testing of the mean difference of two independent samples was used to validate the classification of the parent class to the two child classes considering the four ratios separately. The method was used hierarchically to classify a group of 245 contractors into classes of small numbers. Finally, the inferred procedure of classification proves that the neural network model classified the four-dimension pattern representing contractors efficiently.","King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Construct Engn & Management Dept, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia","Elazouni, AM (corresponding author), King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Construct Engn & Management Dept, POB 346, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia.",elazouni@kfupm.edu.sa,,,,,,29,21,21,0,11,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The methodology provides CEAC computations for project early-stage and middle-stage completion. To this end, this paper establishes three primary objectives, as follows: (1)develop a new formula based on integration of the ES method and four candidate growth models (logistic, Gompertz, Bass, and Weibull), (2)validate the new methodology through its application to nine past projects, and (3)select the equation with the best-performing growth model through testing their statistical validity and comparing the accuracy of their CEAC estimates. Based on statistical validity analysis of the four growth models and comparison of CEAC errors, the CEAC formula based on the Gompertz model is better-fitting and generates more accurate final-cost estimates than those computed by using the other three models and the index-based method. The proposed methodology is a theoretical contribution towards the combination of earned-value metrics with regression-based studies. It also brings practical implications associated with usage of a viable and accurate forecasting technique that considers the schedule impact as a determinant factor of cost behavior.","[Narbaev, Timur] Kazakh British Tech Univ, Int Sch Econ, Alma Ata 050000, Kazakhstan; [Narbaev, Timur; De Marco, Alberto] Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn, I-10129 Turin, Italy","Narbaev, T (corresponding author), Kazakh British Tech Univ, Int Sch Econ, 59 Tole Bi St, Alma Ata 050000, Kazakhstan.",t.narbaev@kbtu.kz; alberto.demarco@polito.it,"De Marco, Alberto/A-4115-2011; Narbaev, Timur/F-4948-2015","De Marco, Alberto/0000-0002-4145-2287; Narbaev, Timur/0000-0002-6401-2700",,,,35,15,15,1,29,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

But, it has not been used for time performance forecasting. Also, the extended methods to EVM for improving the time forecasting have some limitations and deterministic evaluation. Therefore, this research introduces an integrated tool called the fuzzy project performance evaluation (FPPE) system, which is mainly depending on fuzzy theory and polynomial function to evaluate the project performance forecasting (PPF) under uncertainties. Two actual projects are provided to demonstrate the advantages of FPPE system over traditional time forecasting methods (TTFMs). The goal to use the polynomial function is to obtain the best-fit curve that simulates the planned cumulative progress curve (PCPC) of a project. The best two degrees were 11 and 10 for the two Projects A and B respectively. Then, the best-fit curve is updated in the light of new work performed percent to obtain time forecasts, which have been compared against that produced by the critical path method. Such a comparative study reveals that the best-fit provided the most accurate time forecast with the lowest mean absolute percentage of error (MAPE(a)= 0.73% and MAPE(b)= 0.41%). Then, the next step is to incorporate the best-fit procedures into the fuzzy theory to develop the FPPE system, which can be used to help the contractors through detecting early warning points of project performance deterioration and then making corrective decisions. The new integrated system FPPE has been programmed in M-file for MATLAB software and it can be applied to all kind of projects because it works depending on the three EVM curves at the summary of project level.","[Abdelazeem, Abdelazeem S.; Ibrahim, Ahmed H.] Zagazig Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Construct Engn & Util, Zagazig, Egypt","Abdelazeem, AS (corresponding author), Zagazig Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Construct Engn & Util, Zagazig, Egypt.",mekky1999@gmail.com,,,,,,42,0,0,2,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

The survey includes 38 schedule overrun factors and 26 cost escalation factors. The effectiveness degree of the identified factors has been identified by the triangle fuzzy approach. Findings - The results of the survey show that contractor's technical staff is insufficient and ineligible to accomplish the project is the most important cause of schedule overrun, while the major cause of cost escalation is inadequate preparation of the project concerning planning and execution. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is predicting the percentages of schedule overrun and cost escalation of highway projects in Egypt.

Accuracy of estimates is important to project owners and their financiers. However, inconsistent risk information makes this difficult to achieve. Proper risk analysis could offer a partial solution by reducing the variance between design-stage elemental cost plans (ECPs) and final tender sums (FTS) of construction projects. This study first identifies risk factors that influence variability between ECPs and FTS. It further evaluates the identified risk factors through risk measurement to determine the most significant during design development. Data for the study were sourced from 62 practicing quantity surveyors (QS) through an online questionnaire survey. Survey responses were analysed by using descriptive statistics, risk mean analysis (RMA), degree of risk measure and Spearman's correlation. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software facilitated the analysis, and top ten risk factors were found important for practicing quantity surveyors in New Zealand (NZ). The identified risk factors were responsible for the variability observed. The values obtained from the analysis would enable greater accuracy in the forecast of FTS by quantity surveyors. As a main contribution, the study creates awareness of the risk factors that should be given considerable attention by consultants at project outset, to guard against wide variation between the design-stage ECPs and FTS. This knowledge could assist quantity surveyors to pro-actively manage their client's fund. In addition, these findings can assist in the development of a predictive model that construction industry practitioners in NZ could use for reliable estimation of FTS from the design-stage ECP.","[Adafin, Johnson; Wilkinson, Suzanne] Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland, New Zealand; [Rotimi, James O.

Process improvement is facilitated by the development and use of models that account for and illuminate important characteristics of the process. Iteration is a fundamental but often unaddressed feature of product development (PD) processes. Its impact is mediated by the architecture of a process, i.e., its constituent activities and their interactions. This paper integrates several important characteristics of PD processes into a single model, highlighting the effects of varying process architecture. The PD process is modeled as a network of activities that exchange deliverables. Each activity has an uncertain duration and cost, an improvement curve, and risks of rework based on changes in its inputs. A work policy governs the timing of activity execution and deliverable exchange (and thus the amount of activity concurrency). The model is analyzed via simulation, which outputs sample cost and schedule outcome distributions. Varying the process architecture input varies the output distributions. Each distribution is used with a target and an impact function to determine a risk factor. Alternative process architectures are compared, revealing opportunities to trade cost and schedule risk. Example results and applications are shown for an industrial process, the preliminary design of an uninhabited combat aerial vehicle. The model yields and reinforces several managerial insights, including: how rework cascades through a PD process, trading off cost and schedule risk, interface criticality, and occasions for iterative overlapping.","Lockheed Martin Aeronaut Co, Ft Worth, TX 76101 USA; MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Browning, TR (corresponding author), Lockheed Martin Aeronaut Co, Ft Worth, TX 76101 USA.",tyson@alum.mit.edu; eppinger@mit.edu,"Browning, Tyson R/I-1430-2012","Browning, Tyson/0000-0002-9089-1403",,,,85,279,321,4,114,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Design/methodology/approach Stakeholders and CFs were identified through literature review and document analysis. The Delphi method was used to screen the extracted stakeholders and CFs. The focus group methodology was applied to obtain evaluation matrices of relationships between stakeholders and CFs. A two-mode social network was formed to analyse the evaluation matrices generated. Findings Results of the analyses indicate that local governments and policymaking institutions, together with project investors, obtained high prioritisations in the stakeholders' group, whilst senior citizens and caregivers appear to rank last. For CFs, communities' environmental factors receive the most attention from stakeholders. Research limitations/implications Results of the analyses can only show similarities of the participating stakeholders' opinions on their concerns, and provide researchers and practitioners with initial ideas on analysing stakeholders and CFs at the briefing stage of promoting AFCs. For a specific project, the concerns and prioritisations would change. Diverse voices are necessary and case studies are in need. Practical implications Challenges in promoting AFCs in urban China are discussed, and a preliminary framework of the briefing stage is developed for practitioners to follow when promoting AFCs. Originality/value This study discusses which CFs should be considered priorities and what consensuses are generally reached by stakeholders. CFs are utilised to interpret stakeholders' relationships, influences and concerns on AFC projects when conducting the social network analysis (SNA).","[Xiang, Liqun; Jin, Xin; Shen, Geoffrey] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tan, Yongtao] RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Shen, G (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",emma.lq.xiang@connect.polyu.hk; yongtao.tan@rmit.edu.au; verna.x.jin@connect.polyu.hk; geoffrey.shen@polyu.edu.hk,"Tan, Yongtao/J-6829-2014; XIANG, Liqun/AAY-8672-2021; Shen, Geoffrey Qiping/A-1250-2014","Tan, Yongtao/0000-0001-7321-4251; XIANG, Liqun/0000-0003-1965-7160; Shen, Geoffrey Qiping/0000-0002-3111-2019",,,,75,0,0,6,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

To motivate the contractor to put in an extra effort to realize one or more project objectives of an accelerated, costly, and complex undertaking, the owner may offer an award to the contractor. The owner may also threaten the contractor with a penalty if the objectives are not met. This paper reviews the fundamental incentive/disincentive arrangements in contracting literature. Then, results are reported of a survey conducted on a sample of Illinois DOT highway contracts that included I/D provisions. The survey investigates whether there exists an agreement or disagreement between IDOT's and the contractors' perceptions of I/D contract provisions. The findings reveal how I/D contract milestones are established, how they are executed, what kind of work practices the contractor uses to fulfill I/D targets, and how the contracting parties perceive I/D contracts' effectiveness as opposed to non-I/D contracts.

One of the most fundamental issues confronting contractors moving offshore is where to do business. Although international market selection is a much studied topic, the market choices made by construction firms have attracted little attention. This paper aims to identify factors that influence international market selection and to develop an international market selection model for construction firms. The market entry choices of 39 large international Chinese contractors across 87 countries were investigated through logistic regression analysis. The results indicate that international contractors prefer to enter countries with large market potential, small culture distance, and, surprisingly, high country risk and high competitive intensity. Moreover, large, experienced contractors are more willing to compete in international markets. Contrary to generally accepted belief, geographic distance is not revealed to have any significant influence on international market selections by Chinese contractors. This paper will be of interest to contractors considering international market selection as part of their global expansion strategy.","[Chen, Chuan] Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, Project Management, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qi; Li, Hongjiang] Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Martek, Igor] Deakin Univ, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Construct Management, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia","Chen, C (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, Project Management, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",chenchuan@scu.edu.cn; 1406547377@qq.com; igor@deakin.edu.au; 441966828@qq.com,,"Martek, Igor/0000-0001-6573-1291",Sichuan University Humanities and Social Sciences Hundred Young Talents Program; Sichuan Province Hundred Talents Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71371131],"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the Sichuan University Humanities and Social Sciences Hundred Young Talents Program, the Sichuan Province Hundred Talents Program, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), under Project No. 71371131.",,90,22,22,3,69,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The paper analyses this issue by considering the practices (how and when), rationales (why) and outcomes (so what) that evolve in the dynamic management of external stakeholders in dementia-friendly environments. This is a crucial area to explore as the ageing population and rising dementia prevalence has increased the need to engage external stakeholders, such as people living with dementia, to develop dementia-friendly health and social environments. The empirical study of the 2013/2014 Department of Health National Dementia Capital Investment Programme involved a statistical and qualitative analysis of 98 pilot projects? final lessons learnt reports. The analysis advances the dynamic process of timely engaging and disengaging external stakeholders in a context not previously explored in the literature related to dementia-friendly environments. Eight recurring practices and six rationales, the latter characterized by their temporal dimension, are presented in a processual model of stakeholder management.","[Pascale, Federica] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Chelmsford, Essex, England; [Pantzartzis, Efthimia; Price, Andrew D.

Design/methodology/approach Real option principles are applied to assess the public-private investment proportions and the expected return rates of the private sector in a non-competitive guarantee and analyse their effects on the public-private benefit and risk allocations as well as the success of the project. Instead of granting direct capital support, this research accomplishes the compensation of non-competition guarantee by adjusting the project benefit distribution ratios between the government and the private sector to achieve the option value of the guarantee. An empirical example with alternative scales, which is developed from an existing rental village in Geelong, is used to numerically verify the research process. Findings The results illustrate that the option value of the non-competition guarantee plays an important role in supporting the implementation of the PPP rental retirement village projects. The option value of the non-competition guarantee has a close relationship with the guarantee level and the government guarantee cost, which is positively correlated with the guarantee level and negatively correlated with the government guarantee cost. To reduce the government guarantee cost, the government should carefully determine the public-private investment proportion, appropriately control the return rate of the private sector and approve the construction of the new project after the investment recovery of the private sector. Originality/value This research is the first attempt to investigate the government compensation and costs of non-competition guarantee for PPP rental retirement village projects and will enhance the understanding of the nature of PPP applications. The evaluation process and the implementation of the compensation through the adjustment of benefit distribution provides a comprehensive method to analyse the non-competition guarantee of PPP projects and help the parties negotiate in good faith to agree on a method of redress.","[Liu, Shijing; Jin, Hongyu; Liu, Chunlu; Mills, Anthony] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Xie, Benzheng] Shandong Jianzhu Univ, Jinan, Peoples R China","Liu, CL (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",shijing@deakin.edu.au; jinho@deakin.edu.au; chunlu@deakin.edu.au; chunlu_liu@hotmail.com; dhp366@live.com,"Liu, Chunlu/AAW-4172-2020","Liu, Chunlu/0000-0003-1144-4355; JIN, HONGYU/0000-0001-9316-6971",China Scholarship Council (CSC)China Scholarship Council [201508370071],The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their insightful comments and valuable suggestions on an earlier version of the paper.

Therefore, this paper explores the issues that have enhanced low-cost housing (LCH) demand-supply gap from the government housing planners perspective and proffer possible solutions via qualitative insight. This was achieved through a phenomenology type of qualitative approach that covered eight urban states across Malaysia. The study found that government role in ensuring sufficient supply of LCH has not been significantly demonstrated from pre-development to post-development despite various LCH policies. Among the recommendations is the imposed three acres via cumulative ruling on housing developers, enforcement of computerised open registration for eligibility of applicants, and government to establish a sustainable finance scheme to enhance access to housing-loan for only LIEs. The paper concludes that government should enforce engrave of land title deed such that only LIEs would be eligible to possess LCH while the rent-to-own scheme should be managed by an independent agency, and coordinated via the joint task force.

Therefore, problems regarding the client's satisfaction caused by subcontractors can be avoided, and the decision-makers involved in the selection problem can devote to each dass an effort compatible with the impact that activity might have on the project. The novelty of this method is that it was built to reflect the quasi-compensatory rationality of decision-makers in the construction industry; it provides them with insights on subcontractors' activities, and it is grounded on and inspired by a real case study. 'I he new parameters proposed within this model introduce the idea of vetoing an activity being assigned to a class when this activity is incompatible with the decision-maker's preferences.

While comprehensive and ongoing CI applications are employed in a variety of industries to provide valuable input for broad strategic decisions, the construction industry lags behind in adopting this methodology. The use of CI for contract management is an important development in light of the realization on the part of major construction contractors that the diffuse nature of the information and lack of robust analysis create numerous uncertainties during the decision-making processes. The findings of this paper show that Cl has the potential to improve the process for assessing and selecting contractors, through supporting an unbiased and auditable decision making process.

Nevertheless, little is known about its acceptance in the construction community. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify the views of industry stakeholders on safety design in the harmonized safety regulations of South Australia. A desk study on pre- and post-harmonized WHS regulations reveals that design for safety now constitutes a major theme in practice following the harmonization process. After that, a questionnaire survey is conducted to investigate the use of design for safety in the construction industry. The results show that the guidelines promote safety-related design requirements without significantly increasing designers' and contractors' workload. Designers are aware of the hazards on sites and design firms are willing to embrace the guidelines if they are protected from liability. However, the extent to which contracting and procurement systems encourage safety design is uncertain. Moreover, the problem of cost hinders designers in implementing it unless the client accepts it as part of the over-arching life cycle cost structure. There is great uncertainty on whether the concept will be promoted through regulation and subsequently lead to a reduction in hazardous risks and injury rates.","[Bong, Shanan; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen; Ye, Gui] Univ S Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, City East Campus,North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Zuo, Jian] Univ Adelaide, Entrepreneurship Commercialisat & Innovat Ctr, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Li, Rita Yi Man] Hong Kong Shue Yan Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Sustainable Real Estate Res Ctr, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ye, Gui] Chongqing Univ, Sch Construct Management & Real Estate, Chongqing 630044, Peoples R China","Bong, SN (corresponding author), Univ S Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, City East Campus,North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",sageorgezuo@yahoo.com.au; jian.zuo@adelaide.edu.au,"Rameezdeen, Rameez/F-4614-2013; Zuo, Jian/M-3223-2016","Rameezdeen, Rameez/0000-0001-9639-2624; Zuo, Jian/0000-0002-8279-9666; Rita, Li/0000-0003-1944-9425; , gui/0000-0002-3057-7690",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71471023],This project is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 'Research on unsafe group behaviour emergence in construction projects based on artificial societies' (Project No. 71471023).

The study focusses on a form of novel governance structure called an Employer Panel (EP). Design/methodology/approach - The study applies an inductive case study method to investigate the contractor governance mechanisms in 19 out of the 20 major petrochemical instillations located in the UK. Data included interviews, documentary and secondary evidence gathered from the cases and also industry bodies. Findings - The study uncovered three distinct types of governance mode: market, managing contractor, and EP of contractors. The latter relies on the governance process of mandated collaboration to coordinate. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation is the focus on a particular industry, albeit an important one. The research implications include extending the empirical research into other sectors which use on-site contracted maintenance such as ship and aircraft manufacturing. Practical implications - The EP structure with its mandated collaboration process is of value to managers of contractual relationships as it gives insights into coordinative process and it may provide an alternative model for managing outsourcing relationships. Social implications - The mandated collaborative process requires clients to engage its contractors in longer term relationships, thus increasing corporate social responsibility and providing wider job security for contractor employees. Originality/value - The EPmode, as far as can be ascertained, has not been addressed in the literature before.","[Ritson, Neil Henry; Wilson, Mark M.

In examining the tenability of the bidder homogeneity assumption, a linear mixed modeling approach is applied to two data sets obtained from Hong Kong and Singapore contractors via a bidding experiment. Two linear mixed models were developed by relating the contractors' mark-up decision to four project decision environment factors, namely, (1) market conditions; (2) number of bidders; (3) project type; and (4) project size. The results show that not only is there a significant heterogeneity between the Hong Kong and the Singapore contractors in terms of both their preferences (intercepts) and responses (slopes) to the project decision environment factors that affect their mark-up decision, but also that the individual Hong Kong and Singapore contractors have different degrees of sensitivity toward the project decision environment factors (which is reflected in the varying individual-specific intercepts and slopes).

The purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated profit maximization model (IPMM) that aims for maximum expected profit by using time-cost tradeoff analysis, adjusted start times of activities, minimized financing cost and minimized extension of work schedule beyond the contract duration. This kind of integrated approach was never researched in the past. Design/methodology/approach IPMM is programmed into an automated system using MATLAB 2016a. It generates an optimal work schedule that leads to maximum profit by means of time-cost tradeoff analysis considering different activity acceleration/deceleration methods and adjusting the start/finish times of activities. While doing so, IPMM minimizes the contractor's financing cost by considering combinations of different financing alternatives such as short-term loans, long-term loans and lines of credit. IPMM also considers the impact of extending the project duration on project profit. Findings IPMM is tested for different project durations, for the optimality of the solutions, differing activity start/finish times and project financing alternatives. In all cases, contractors can achieve maximum profit by using IPMM. Research limitations/implications - IPMM considers a deterministic project schedule, whereas stochastic time-cost tradeoff analysis can improve its performance. Resource allocation and resource leveling are not considered in IPMM, but can be incorporated into the model in future research. Finally, the long computational time is a challenge that needs to be overcome in future research. Practical implications - IPMM is likely to increase profits and improve the chances of contractors to survive and grow compared to their competitors. The practical value of IPMM is that any contractor can and should use IPMM since all the data required to run IPMM is available to the contractor at the time the contract is signed. The contractor who provides information about network logic, schedule data, cost data, contractual terms, and available financing alternatives and their APRs can use an automated IPMM that adjusts activity start times and durations, minimizes financing cost, eliminates or minimizes time extensions, minimizes total cost and maximizes expected profit. Originality/value - Unlike any prior study that looks into contractors' profits by considering the impact of only one or two factors at a time, this study presents an IPMM that considers all major factors that affect profits, namely, time-cost tradeoff analysis, adjusted start times of activities, minimized financing cost and minimized extension of work schedule beyond the contract duration.","[Alavipour, S.

The main purpose of this paper is to examine how construction clients' procurement procedures affect the balance between cooperation and competition (i.e., coopetition) in client-contractor relationships. The empirical results, based on a survey to 87 Swedish construction clients, show that clients' procurement procedures facilitate a focus on competition. It was also found that clients' earlier experience of a certain procedure heavily affects their procurement choices, thereby preserving old behaviors. Although two-thirds of the clients wish to increase cooperation with contractors, this does not affect their procurement decisions. This study therefore concludes that the theoretical framework, based on transaction cost economics, is correct in prescribing more cooperation than is empirically observed in the construction sector. The theoretical framework can increase clients' awareness of how procurement affects cooperation and competition, thereby serving as a basis for more unbiased and systematic procurement decisions, facilitating cooperation-based coopetition.","Lulea Univ Technol, Div Business Adm & Management, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden","Eriksson, PE (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Div Business Adm & Management, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",pererik.eriksson@ltu.se,,"Eriksson, Per Erik/0000-0002-1746-2637",,,,56,62,66,0,42,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

However, the issue of whether A/E/C organizations are receiving adequate returns from their IT investments remains an important managerial concern. Recently, Pena-Mora, Vadhavkar, Perkins, and Weber introduced a strategic IT planning framework for construction projects that includes four steps: environmental scan, internal scrutiny, IT diffusion analysis, and IT investment modeling. It analyzes the external and internal IT conditions of a project/firm, identifies the diffusion phase of IT in the project/firm, and finally evaluates the effects of IT investments on the project/firm. Although this framework was originally intended to plan future IT investments, we assume that the framework can also be used to evaluate ongoing or past IT investments in projects/firms. Following this idea, this paper presents an application of the Pena-Mora et al. framework to an ongoing IT project in Kajima Corporation, one of the largest Japanese general contractors. Kajima is currently developing an IT system called LINCS (Linkage of Information for a New Construction System). This synthetic information network system has been designed to share building data among design and construction stages and streamline design/build activities. By using the framework proposed in this paper, we analyzed how LINCS is justified in terms of its strategic and operational value for Kajima and its construction projects.","MIT, Ctr Construct Res & Educ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Kajima Corp, Architectural & Engn Design Div, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1078502, Japan","Pena-Mora, F (corresponding author), MIT, Ctr Construct Res & Educ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, MIT Room 1-253,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",feniosky@mit.edu; shunsuke@alum.mit.edu,,,,,,15,15,16,0,4,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

The process involves evaluation of owner and contractor competencies and determination of the best possible sourcing strategy for each competency required in the owner's capital program. The sourcing strategy is defined in terms of work relationships that clearly identify primary and secondary roles and responsibilities. The resulting work structure helps owners and contractors avoid gaps and eliminate overlaps in their work relationships. The proposed process also provides an approach to evaluate alignment of work structures between owner's corporate objectives and their capital programs. Work structure and alignment indicators consider project delivery approaches, contract types, organizational relationships, and other relevant factors such as proprietary technology. Thus, this paper provides a decision process that can help managers optimize owner and contractor competencies for capital program success.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Civil Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Union Carbide Corp, Seadrift Project Grp, Seadrift, TX USA","Anderson, SD (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Civil Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,,,,,,13,5,5,0,8,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the selection of design-builders for public buildings seeking leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) certification and compare the selection practices involved with those of non-LEED-seeking DB projects through a robust content analysis of 74 DB requests for proposals (RFPs) for public DB projects. The results of the content analysis reveal that the level of LEED certification is the dominant means of conveying the sustainability requirements in RFPs for contractor selection, with the majority of RFPs (60%) including sustainability requirements as part of the contractor evaluation package. With the exception of contractors' past performance, there is no statistically significant difference in the importance weights of selection criteria between LEED-seeking and non-LEED-seeking buildings, and DB owners tend to place more emphasis on innovative technical solutions rather than the past performance of DB contractors. Additionally, the research findings also indicate that owners of LEED-seeking building projects tend to provide fewer design decisions in RFPs to solicit innovative design alternatives from potential DB contractors. This study provides DB owners with a number of practical implications for selecting appropriate design-builders for green DB projects.

Using a set of questionnaires, data were accrued from 385 pairs of project managers and employees of contractors. The data were analyzed by structural equation modeling to identify the effects of Confucian principles on project performance and the mediating role of transactional leadership and transformational leadership. The analysis revealed that all Confucian principles had positive effects on transactional and transformational leadership styles, and both had positive effects on project performance. Also, project leadership played a complete mediating role. Transactional leadership had a stronger effect on objective performance than on subjective performance, whereas transformational leadership had a stronger impact on subjective performance than on objective performance. Subjective performance had a positive influence on objective performance.

The study used manufacturing meta-analysis COQ percentages as a basis for comparison with water utility organizations. Three water utilities El Paso Water Utility (EWU), Lubbock Water Utility (LWU), and San Antonio Water System (SAWS), were chosen to be included in this study because they represented three different populations, three different water source combinations, and three different county water usages. Using non-parametric statistics between manufacturing organizations and water utility organizations, the results show that prevention, failure, and total COQ are statistically different, yet appraisal costs are the same. A sensitivity analysis and a Pareto analysis performed on the data resulted in actionable analytics for researchers.

The paper addresses this shortfall. It derives the optimal outcome sharing arrangement for risk-neutral and risk-averse contractors within the consortium, and between the consortium and a risk-neutral owner. Practitioners were engaged in a designed exercise in order to validate the paper's propositions. The paper demonstrates that, at the optimum: the proportion of outcome sharing among contractors with the same risk-attitude should reflect the levels of their contributions; the proportion of outcome sharing among contractors with the same level of contribution should be lower for contractors with higher levels of risk aversion; a consortium of risk-neutral contractors should receive or bear any favourable or adverse project outcome respectively; and the proportion of outcome sharing to a consortium of risk-averse contractors should reduce, and the fixed component of the consortium fee should increase, when the contractors become more risk-averse or the level of the project outcome uncertainty increases. The paper proposes an original solution to the optimal sharing problem in contracts with a consortium of contractors, thereby contributing to current practices in contracts management.","[Hosseinian, S.

However, existing models overlook value-in-use, and thus, do not offer a complete estimation of a project's value. Thus, this study proposes a value estimation model using the service-dominant logic, which emphasizes an owner's journey throughout the project and considers both exchange value and value-in-use. The model structures and estimates construction project value according to potential events caused by the contractor.

Design/methodology/approach The data of 95 steel structural building projects were collected via a questionnaire to evaluate the proposed framework for the Iranian construction industry. Based on unofficial local construction statistics and literature reviews, six safety influential factors (SIFs) were selected to which a cost could be assigned. The costs associated with various levels were also determined for each SIF through literature reviews and expert interviews. A multiple linear regression (MLR) model was developed as a predictive model to determine PSL for future projects based on the data of previous projects. Moreover, linear programming (LP) was applied to take modeling constraints and project conditions into account. Findings The results demonstrated the impacts of all the factors on PSL and the model's potential for the preliminary estimation of PSL using SIFs. The results also indicated that a higher PSL could be achieved by optimizing the allocation of financial resources to each SIF. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by developing a step-by-step framework to identify an optimal safety cost allocation (OSCA) to achieve the maximum possible PSL using a limited safety budget and considering the data of similar projects.

This paper proposes novel Kalman filters for predicting the movements of the workers and mobile equipment on the construction sites. The filters take the positions of the equipment and workers estimated from multiple video cameras as input and output the corresponding predictions on their future positions. Moreover, the filters could adjust their predictions based on the worker or equipment's previous movements. The effectiveness of the filters has-been tested with real site videos and the results show the high prediction accuracy of the filters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, a variety of barriers impede a holistic BIM implementation. Due to these barriers, some general contractors outsource the creation and use of BIM models to specialized Information Technology (IT) firms. Since limited literature currently exists for BIM outsourcing, this study aims to identify BIM outsourcing patterns among the general contractors across the US and the perceived impacts it has on construction projects. Analysis of two-hundred and fifty-two complete responses from general contracting firms determines that 45% of responding companies have outsourced BIM, this signifies that outsourcing has become an important facet of BIM implementation. Data was also collected on company demographics, BIM outsourcing locations, strategic reasons for outsourcing, and various other aspects related to BIM outsourcing. The results indicate that respondents perceive BIM outsourcing as less efficient than in-house BIM implementation. However, continued use of outsourcing for BIM functions also displays the adaptability of the industry in meeting challenges and embracing new technology through alternative methods, despite the potential risks.","[Fountain, James; Langar, Sandeep] Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Construct, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Langar, Sandeep] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Construct Sci, San Antonio, TX 78207 USA; [Fountain, James] Fountain Construct Co Inc, Jackson, MS 39209 USA","Langar, S (corresponding author), Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Construct, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.; Langar, S (corresponding author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Construct Sci, San Antonio, TX 78207 USA.",JFountain@fountainconstruction.com; sandeep.langar@utsa.edu,,"Langar, Sandeep/0000-0001-7955-1646",University of Southern Mississippi's The Eagle SPUR scholarship,"Part of this research was supported by The University of Southern Mississippi's The Eagle SPUR scholarship.

Past research has shown that there is a link between design decisions and fatalities. Prevention through Design (PtD) is a concept that attempts to identify and mitigate hazards early in the design process with the goal of eliminating the risks of injury to workers and/or damage to facilities during construction. PtD is a required practice in some countries, primarily because of legislation. In the United States, however, PtD is not well known by design professionals and there is opposition to its practice. The objective of this paper is to present the results of a Delphi study, in which the Delphi panel was tasked to identify: (1)the construction industry group with the most influence to generate interest in PtD in the United States, (2)the method with which that interest can be achieved, and (3)the industry group that should be targeted with that method. The Delphi panel came to a consensus that owners have the greatest influence to generate interest, and they should be the group to be targeted using the business case method.","[Tymvios, Nicholas] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Engn Technol & Construct Management, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Gambatese, John A.] Oregon State Univ, Sch Civil & Construct Engn, 101 Kearney Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Tymvios, N (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Engn Technol & Construct Management, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",ntymvios@uncc.edu; john.gambatese@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,40,21,21,3,28,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

This paper presents a web-based semantic system for managing products' life cycle costs. The basic architecture of the proposed system represents costs as a hierarchy of cost elements. Each cost element has a dollar value that could be deterministic, probabilistic, or fuzzy. Several factors (also represented in hierarchies) can have a set of impacts on the values of these costs. Through the analysis of different impact possibilities and probabilities, a decision maker can study various alternative scenarios and define the optimum set of costs and their values. A set of web services are used to capture cost elements, factors, and their impacts. The semantic nature of the system allows for it to be an integral part of a corporate memory system, where decision makers will be able to document and access lessons learned about LCC optimization. Finally, the proposed system includes a framework for a LCC-centered supply chain, where all stakeholders can collaborate in optimizing product LCC.","Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Ctr Informat Syst Infrastruct & Construct, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada","El-Diraby, TE (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Ctr Informat Syst Infrastruct & Construct, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada.",,"El-Diraby, Tamer E./N-6536-2019; El-Diraby, Tamer/E-8199-2015","El-Diraby, Tamer E./0000-0001-6446-9199; El-Diraby, Tamer/0000-0001-6446-9199",,,,27,20,20,0,7,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

These macrolevel studies attempt to quantify the productivity or changes in productivity over the entire industry or a segment of the industry. This study is aimed at a micro or project level examination of productivity. The tool developed allows a company to predict, manage, and even optimize the productivity associated with a project or levels of projects. Automated productivity-based schedule animation (APBSA) is a dynamic scheduling methodology that stochastically utilizes weekly trended construction labor productivity data in order to automatically update the baseline schedule that was created at the beginning of the project by the construction manager. APBSA reports the construction activity duration variances and animates the progress of the job with most current data available in a four-dimensional (4D) environment. Contractors can improve their planning by utilizing APBSA with building information modeling (BIM) which will help them to improve their craft productivity. As a case study, a three-story Systems Engineering Facility III of Hanscom Air Force Base (AFB) was modeled. The model was developed in order to demonstrate the impacts of time and cost-based stochastic productivity indices on the baseline schedule. A time-cost trade-off analysis was also performed in order to show effects of duration variations on the cost of the project.","[Gelisen, Gokhan] Skanska USA Civil Northeast Inc, Queens, NY 11377 USA; [Griffis, F.

Previous research works always considered CSLP from the aspect of reducing cost and treated SCLP as a single objective optimization problem. In the paper, CSLP was designed by a multi-objective optimization (MOO) model using modified Pareto-based ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, which could find a Pareto solution (trade-off layout) to fulfill the requirement of reducing cost and improve the site safety level simultaneously. Furthermore, in order to apply MOO model to solve unequal-area problem, the random grids-recognition strategy was employed in the proposed MOO model to solve the unequal-area site layout problems without increasing the computational complexities. A case study of a residential building project is used to validate the proposed MOO model and the results are very positive. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The system identifies the optimal trade-off between a construction owner's satisfaction and a contractor's satisfaction. It is important to reconcile the project participants' conflicting interests because the construction owner aims to maximize the quality of construction while the contractor aims to minimize the cost of construction. MOGA is used to optimize resource allocation when owner satisfaction and contractor satisfaction are pursued at the same time under a limited budget. Multi-objective optimization is integrated with simulation to effectively deal with the uncertainties of the QFD input and the variability of the QFD output. This study is of value to practitioners because SQCO allows for the establishment of a quality plan that satisfies all of the multi project participants. The study is also of relevance to researchers in that it allows researchers to expeditiously identify an optimal design alternative of construction methods and operations. A test case implemented with a curtain-wall unit verifies the usability and validity of the system in practice.","[Lim, Tae-Kyung] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Architecture & Civil Engn, Taegu 702701, South Korea; [Jang, Won-Suk] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Gyeongsa Si 712749, Gyeongsangbuk D, South Korea; [Choi, Jae-ho] Dong A Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Pusan 604714, South Korea; [Lee, Dong-Eun] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Architecture & Civil Engn, Taegu 702701, South Korea","Lee, DE (corresponding author), Dong A Univ, Dept Civil Engn, P4401,840 Hadan2 Dong, Pusan 604714, South Korea.",dolee@knu.ac.kr,,"LEE, DONG-EUN/0000-0001-9205-3836","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [2013R1A2A2A01068316]","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (NO. 2013R1A2A2A01068316).

The traditional critical-path method (CPM) misleads because there are few, if any, real-life deterministic situations for which CPM is a great match; program evaluation and review technique (PERT) has been seen to have its problems, too (e.g., merge bias, unavailability of data, difficulty of implementation by practitioners). A dual focus on the distributions of the possible errors in the time and cost estimates and on the reliability of the estimates used as planned values suggests an approach for developing reliable schedules and budgets with buffers for time and cost. This method for budgeting and scheduling is executed through either simulation or a simple analytical approximation. The dynamic buffers provide much-needed flexibility, accounting for the errors in cost and duration estimates associated with planning any real project, thus providing a realistic, practical, and dynamic approach to planning and scheduling.

To establish a progress curve, the costs that are associated with each scheduling activity must be determined. However, the distributions of the quantities (costs) of cost items among various activities are time-consuming to obtain and error prone, yielding an unreliable S-curve. This work proposes the use of three-dimensional building information model (BIM) objects to integrate schedule and cost by using the powerful BIM for data acquisition and storage. BIM objects are incorporated into a proposed four-step model to establish construction progress curves. The proposed model defines search criteria (cost item, object, floor, and zone) that precisely identify takeoff objects for extracting the quantities of cost items associated with each activity. The BIM uses keynote, assembly code, and family type catalog functions to provide pop-up menus for the efficient identification of cost items that are associated with each object to preventing errors in the manual typing of cost-item names. Finally, this work demonstrates that uploading the cost items and unit prices into cost estimation software in advance is critical to automating cost estimations in BIM. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Prior to contractor selection, prequalification is an important step, which requires contractors with certain capabilities in addition to traditional features. This study aims to develop a systematic and practical model for prequalification in GB projects using a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach by adopting the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Design/methodology/approach The AHP model with 8 main criteria groups and 25 sub-criteria is structured based on literature review and professional opinions accompanied by a pilot study. Then, interviews with experts, who are experienced in the development and application phases of GB projects in Turkey, are arranged to collect judgements. The agreement levels between different groups of experts are analysed via Pearson's and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Model applicability is tested on six hypothetical contractors for practicality. Findings The results show that i) financial capabilities, ii) legal status and iii) sustainability groups are the top three main criteria, while i) compliance with schedule requirements of the client, ii) current legal status including suits, iii) negative litigation history records, iv) contractor's compliance capacity to client's sustainability checklist for the proposed project and v) sustainability with lower life cycle cost (durability, maintenance, constructability) are the top five sub-criteria. Originality/value There is a gap in the literature analysing contractor prequalification phase in GB projects.

There is still a need to investigate this issue by looking at stakeholders higher in the supply chain, particularly the ones who have the economic power to facilitate safety implementation.

Data were collected using questionnaire surveys from employees working in small and medium construction projects in Australia. The findings of the research have not only confirmed the importance of clients in implementing safety, but also determined specific client roles that influence the development of safety climate in construction projects. It is recommended that clients should focus on the following six safety roles: participate in site-based safety program; review and analyze safety data; appoint safety team; select safe contractors; specify how safety is to be addressed in tenders; and perform regular checks on plant/equipment. Some clients may not consider safety as important as other traditional objectives, such as time, cost, environment, and quality. As such, they need to recognize the economic benefit of safety, thus becoming willing and committed to integrating safety into day-to-day business decisions.

This study aims to conceptualize resilient safety culture in the construction environment by integrating resilience engineering principles into the concept of safety culture. To fulfill this research aim, a correlational research design was used. Data were collected using questionnaire surveys targeting construction project managers involved in the delivery of 78 recently completed building projects in Vietnam. The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique with partial least-squares estimation (PLS) was used to analyze the data. The results confirmed 3 dimensions (i.e.,psychological resilience, behavioral resilience, and contextual resilience) with 24 measurable scale items to assess safety culture with respect to resilience. The study also revealed that psychological resilience has a weaker impact on accident prevention under higher contextual resilience and behavioral resilience levels. Theoretically, this study provides the theoretical development and empirical evidence to clarify the concept of resilient safety culture in terms of definition, purpose, and value in the context of construction projects. In practical terms, the study suggests that project hazards, unexpected events, and the risk tolerance of construction workers should be addressed to achieve consistently high safety performance. It also offers construction organizations a framework of safety practices to assess their capabilities in managing on-site safety risks.","[Minh Tri Trinh; Feng, Yingbin] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Mohamed, Sherif] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Engn, Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia","Feng, YB (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",y.feng@uws.edu.au,,"Feng, Yingbin/0000-0002-3832-0152; Trinh, Minh Tri/0000-0003-4024-220X","Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam; Western Sydney University [P00022974]","This research was jointly supported by the Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam, and Western Sydney University (Project ID: P00022974).",,61,5,6,8,54,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The comprehensive risk assessment model is capable of assessing nine safety indicators, which can be categorised into workers' behaviour, environment and machine-related safety indicators, and the model is embedded in the safety prewarning system. The safety prewarning system can automatically extract safety information from surveillance cameras based on computer vision, assess risks based on the embedded comprehensive risk assessment model, categorise risks into five levels and provide timely suggestions. Design/methodology/approach Firstly, the comprehensive risk assessment model is constructed by adopting grey multihierarchical analysis method. The method combines the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the grey clustering evaluation in the grey theory. Expert knowledge, obtained through the questionnaire approach, contributes to set weights of risk indicators and evaluate risks. Secondly, a safety prewarning system is developed, including data acquisition layer, data processing layer and prewarning layer. Computer vision is applied in the system to automatically extract real-time safety information from the surveillance cameras. The safety information is then processed through the comprehensive risk assessment model and categorized into five risk levels. A case study is presented to verify the proposed mechanism. Findings Through a case study, the result shows that the proposed mechanism is capable of analyzing integrated human-machine-environment risk, timely categorising risks into five risk levels and providing potential suggestions. Originality/value The comprehensive risk assessment model is capable of assessing nine risk indicators, identifying three types of entities, workers, environment and machine on the construction site, presenting the integrated risk based on nine indicators. The proposed mechanism, which adopts expert knowledge through Building Information Modeling (BIM) safety simulation and extracts safety information based on computer vision, can perform a dynamic real-time risk analysis, categorize risks into five risk levels and provide potential suggestions to corresponding risk owners. The proposed mechanism can allow the project manager to take timely actions.","[Xu, Wenpei; Wang, Ting-Kwei] Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, BIM Res Ctr, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Wang, TK (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, BIM Res Ctr, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",20180302032t@cqu.edu.cn; tingkwei@cqu.edu.cn,,"Wang, Ting-Kwei/0000-0001-8946-3797","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [4418a4c4930741678058b6cb12ca860c]; Shenzhen THS Hi-Tech Corporation",This paper is vitally supported by industry-university-research cooperation Project [no. 4418a4c4930741678058b6cb12ca860c] of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China and Shenzhen THS Hi-Tech Corporation.

However, some organizations treat quality management as a routine exercise and pay little attention to the implementation of quality management systems. As a result, the expected improvement in quality at both project and organization levels has not been truly realized. Concurrent checking, reporting and auditing are necessary to improve the quality of an organization and its works. However, an immense amount of time and effort is required to report, input, retrieve, analyze and disseminate the data instantaneously. Therefore, an automated and user-friendly quality management system would be helpful. A web-based quality management system could be an effective tool for gathering, filtering, managing, assessing, and sharing quality data at project and corporate levels. The aim of this study is to examine the potential for applying the web-based techniques to collect, manage, assess and distribute quality-related data. A prototype system has been developed, and the results indicate that quality management data can be collected from various project participants to improve the transparency and efficiency of a construction project.

By sharing its own incentive reward with other contractors for acquiring extra equipment, a contractor with a lack of equipment resources can reduce time delays and even complete projects in advance. This paper focuses on analyzing onsite construction equipment sharing among contractors from different sections of the same project. First, two forms of time incentives are applied to encourage the contractors to decrease their construction duration by sharing equipment resources. Then, based on an analysis of the influence that equipment sharing has on construction duration, a Stackelberg model among the equipment-sharing contractors is developed to build the contractors' gain functions and simulate the equipment-sharing process. Finally, a numerical analysis is conducted to analyze the effect that a time incentive and construction costs have on the contractors' benefits. The results demonstrate that the incentive for a contractor needing more equipment is positively associated with the gains of both contractors, whereas the incentive for the contractor lending out equipment acts inversely. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge for understanding the process of onsite equipment sharing among contractors. By capturing the contractors' aspect of equipment sharing, this study provides a practical model to aid the client in settling resource-leveling problems rather than using traditional approaches that have been conducted from the client's perspective. This research should be beneficial for project managers to better understand how suitable incentive contracts can facilitate equipment sharing among contractors and consequently help ensure construction schedule.","[Liu, Zhi] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Automat, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hongwei] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Li, Heng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Wang, HW (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",lzfighter@163.com; hwwang@mail.hust.edu.cn; bshengli@polyu.edu.hk,"Li, Heng/B-2821-2015; wang, hongwei/G-3843-2013","Li, Heng/0000-0002-3187-9041; wang, hongwei/0000-0002-6206-7353",,,,33,3,3,1,34,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

In particular, top construction firms have benefited greatly from ERM practices by establishing their own risk management philosophies and systems. The aim of this study is to explore current ERM practices of top international contractors, as ranked by the Engineering News Record (ENR), and to identify an ERM practice model adopted by top ENR international contractors. An archival research method was employed for this study, combining a coding framework and thematic analysis, using the 2013 annual reports of the top ENR international contractors. The research proposes an integrated ERM model for analysis which combines ERM process, ERM operations and an ERM control environment. In addition, the research investigates the home location, main overseas market and main industry sector as being the external driving factors of ERM practices adopted by top ENR international contractors. The study concludes that ERM practice is a proactive and continuing process for the international contractors, driven by their internal enterprise culture and risk management desires as well as other external requirements.","[Liu, Junying; Zhang, Qiang] Tianjin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Low, Sui Pheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Bldg, Singapore, Singapore","Zhang, Q (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",zqyuyu@126.com,,,,,,45,4,4,3,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

Although there are substantial efforts to achieve a high level of safety culture, the traditional approaches may not be sufficient to ensure the sustained improvement of the safety performance due to the complex nature of construction projects. This technical note aims to discuss the concept of resilient safety culture and its application in the construction environment. A conceptual model for a resilient safety culture was developed on the basis of the safety culture theory, the resilience engineering theory, the latent failure model, the human error theory, the high reliability theory, and the normal accident theory. The conceptual model proposes a measurement method for the resilient safety culture of construction projects and explains how a resilient safety culture can be created in a construction organization. This paper also proposes hypotheses regarding the effect of the project complexity and resilient safety culture on the safety performance of construction projects, on the basis of the normal accident theory. The model may serve as the theoretical basis for establishing an ultrasafe construction organization that is expected to achieve a consistently high safety performance regardless of the changing complexity levels and conditions of its construction projects.","[Minh Tri Trinh; Feng, Yingbin; Jin, Xiaohua] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia","Feng, YB (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",yingbin.feng@gmail.com,"Jin, Xiao-Hua/N-1483-2018","Jin, Xiao-Hua/0000-0003-0877-9533; Feng, Yingbin/0000-0002-3832-0152; Trinh, Minh Tri/0000-0003-4024-220X","Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam; Western Sydney University [P00022974]","This research is jointly supported by the Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam, and Western Sydney University (Project P00022974).",,37,13,14,3,57,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Design/methodology/approach The authors interviewed eight such contractors, and used activity theory as a lens to analyze the results. The authors investigated project marketing activities at four stages of the project contract life cycle, and against four enablers of collaboration. Findings The authors have identified that the service-dominant logic pervades project marketing. Through the project contract life cycle the marketing activity starts with a strategic focus, becomes tactical, then operational and returns to strategic. Project marketing involves executive managers, marketing, client or account managers and project managers. Project managers have a key responsibility for project marketing. The four enablers of collaboration, relationships, communication, going-with and trust, support each other and the entire project marketing activity. Research limitations/implications As a contribution to theory, the authors have identified the practices adopted by contractors in project-based industries to market their competencies to clients to win new work and maintain relationships with existing clients. The authors have identified practices throughout the contract life cycle, and practices to develop collaboration. The next step will be to explain these practices in terms of traditional marketing theory. Practical implications The results provide guidelines to contractors in project-based industries who wish to improve their marketing activity to achieve sustainable performance. Industry may also find it useful to train or coach their project managers to be conscious of their marketing role. Originality/value Previous work has been conceptual in nature and has speculated on the nature of the project marketing performed by contractors to win new projects, and set it against marketing done by the project. This research has empirically investigated the actual marketing practices adopted by project contracting organizations, shown how it varies through the project life cycle and shown how responsibility passes from senior management to the account team and then to project managers.

One of the technologies for biofuels production is fast pyrolysis; however, to increase manufacturing of fast pyrolysis units, a better understanding of stakeholders' requirements and perspectives is needed. This is a complex decision problem. Due to the diversity of perspectives, each group of stakeholders has their own unique requirements, which in total will determine the right manufacturing approach. Previous studies either investigated optimal sizing from a single viewpoint or have combined a subset of perspectives. This study applies multiple tools to develop a more comprehensive view of stakeholders' perspectives. Individual subject matter experts were asked to review and prioritize a set of requirements that reflected different stakeholders' perspectives, including economic, environmental, technical, social, and legal. The perspectives were then used to analyze multiple fast pyrolysis units to determine which size was the most effective in meeting the perspectives in total. The analysis indicated that the smallest unit, able to process an average of 50 tons per day, is the best alternative when viewed from the economic, technical, social, and legal perspectives. However, when viewed from the environmental perspective, a medium-sized unit, able to process in the range of 200-500 tons per day, is the best alternative. This work provides the basis for further discussions about the individual perspectives, including the economic and environmental perspectives of biofuel production. Potential avenues for further work in assessment of stakeholders' requirements are also noted.","[Fawzy, Mostafa F.] Iowa State Univ, Ind Engn, Ames, IA USA; [Componation, Paul J.] Univ Texas Arlington, Ind Mfg & Syst Engn Dept, Arlington, TX 76019 USA","Fawzy, MF (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Ind & Mfg Syst Engn Dept, 3004 Black Engn Bldg, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",mffawzy@iastate.edu,,,,,,38,4,4,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1042-9247,2377-0643,,ENG MANAG J,EMJ-Eng.

Failure in identification and assessment of risks can lead to inadequacy in the process of managing risks, which in turn can critically affect the projects' resources. A formal risk management is rarely practised in construction projects due to the lack of contractors' awareness of key risks. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the investigation of risk factors in construction projects in Italy from contractors' perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data, based on which a total of ten key risks were ascertained. The identified risks were compared with the findings of the surveys conducted in the Australian and Chinese construction industry to address the unique risks associated with construction projects in Italy. Findings - The key risks included delays in payments, client variations, design variations, inaccurate cost estimates, and tight project schedules. The comparison between those three countries specified the delays in payments and project funding problems as the most critical factors that are related to cultural influences and behaviour of clients. The findings assist contractors in the risk identification process, and can be applied to the development of a risk management framework for construction projects. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this study cannot be generalised statistically for the whole of Italy as it was constrained geographically, with respondents drawn only from a self-selection sample of construction projects in the Veneto region of Northern Italy. The findings represent a snapshot of the key potential internal and external risks from the perspective of contractors. Originality/value - The results of the study specified the key risks of construction projects from the perspective of contractors which can contribute to risk management for construction projects.","[Rostami, Ali] Univ Wolverhampton, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Wolverhampton, England; [Oduoza, Chike F.] Univ Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, England","Rostami, A (corresponding author), Univ Wolverhampton, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Wolverhampton, England.",ali.rostami@hotmail.co.uk,,,,,,46,10,10,3,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

The procedure involves judging the suitability, capability and competency of the contractor on various criteria, using both anecdotal and empirical evidence. The evidence used is often imprecise and subjective, and so is the evaluation and decision making procedure. Type-1 fuzzy sets have been used in the prequalification procedure to handle uncertain information. However, type-1 fuzzy sets are unable to reflect the differences in opinion among experts involved in group decision making. The purpose of this paper is to propose a practical prequalification procedure that uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets to address both linguistic imprecision and differences of opinion. A numerical example shows how the proposed procedure is carried out and the benefits that result compared to a similar procedure using type-1 fuzzy sets.","[Afshar, Mohammad Reza; Alipouri, Yagub; Sebt, Mohammad Hassan] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Chan, Weng Tat] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil Engn, Singapore 119260, Singapore","Chan, WT (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil Engn, Singapore 119260, Singapore.",m.afshar67@aut.ac.ir; yalipouri@aut.ac.ir; sebt@aut.ac.ir; ceecwt@nus.edu.sg,"Alipouri, Yaghoub/AAS-4965-2020; Sebt, Mohammad Hassan/M-3131-2018","Sebt, Mohammad Hassan/0000-0002-5276-1827; afshar, mohammad reza/0000-0002-9544-2519; Chan, Weng Tat/0000-0001-7012-9115; Alipouri, Yaghoub/0000-0002-4934-5435",,,,28,23,23,1,32,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Bidding is risky because the actual cost of the job is unknown. Thus, the bid should be high enough to make a profit but low enough to win the bidding. The result of competition depends on the competitor's risk-taking behaviors, which are affected by the organization's risk attitudes. A contractor's risk-taking is an essential element of the construction business. The current study explores the domain of competition at the aggregate market level. An evolutionary simulation model was developed to investigate the effects of risk attitude on a contractor's success and on the market structure. The analysis accounts for different risk-taking behaviors in competition, different performances by contractors, corresponding organizational changes, and aggregate patterns in the form of the market structure. The study finds that risk attitude is a competitive characteristic of contractors. The results provide new insight on competition in the market place, and explanations are given for a contractor's competitive success. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000284.

The ICW primarily has two forms on a construction site: conflicts with supervisors (ICWS) and conflicts with coworkers (ICWC). This study examined the occurrences of ICWS and ICWC on construction sites, and investigated the relationship among ICWS, ICWS, and physical safety outcomes together with job stress. In addition, possible antecedents of ICWS and ICWC including workhours, mobility, and individual resilience were also examined. The research was based on 837 surveys collected from more than 100 construction sites in Ontario, Canada between July 2015 and July 2016. Structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques were used to test the hypothesized relationships. This paper leads to the following conclusions. Although ICW was reported as quite often or very often by only 6.3% of respondents, it had a significant effect on both physical safety outcomes, including physical injuries and unsafe events, and job stress. Individual resilience (IR) had a significant negative correlation with both ICWS and ICWC, which in turn could decrease the frequency of physical safety outcomes and job stress. The contributions of this study are that safety professionals may consider adding coping skill training safety programs to improve the individual resilience of their workforce and reduce conflict-related safety outcomes.

However, the actual process of how contractors and their clients negotiate and agree to price is complex and not clearly articulated in the literature. With participant observation, the entire tender process was shadowed in two leading U. K. construction firms. This was compared with propositions in analytical models, and significant differences were found. A total of 670 h of work observed in both firms revealed three stages of the bidding process. Bidding activities were categorized and their extent estimated as deskwork (32%), calculations (19%), meetings (14%), documents (13%), off-days (11%), conversations (7%), correspondence (3%), and travel (1%). Risk allowances of 1-2% were priced in some bids, and three tiers of risk apportionment in bids were identified. However, priced risks may be excluded from the final bid to enhance competitiveness. Although risk apportionment affects a contractor's pricing strategy, other complex microeconomic factors also affect price. Instead of including pricing contingencies, risk was priced primarily through contractual rather than price mechanisms to reflect commercial imperatives. These findings explain why some assumptions underpinning analytical models may not be sustainable in practice and why what actually happens in practice is important for those who seek to model the pricing of construction bids.

While certain studies have been carried out to examine the critical success factors (CSFs) for sub-contractors, it is unrealistic to assume that these CSFs are relevant to all types of sub-contractors. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to establish a set of CSFs for those construction sub-contractors which are labour-intensive in nature. To achieve that, a self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted in Hong Kong. A set of CSFs pertinent to labour-intensive sub-contractors are first identified through descriptive statistics. The CSFs are then compared with those pertinent to equipment-intensive trade specialists. Finally, the identified CSFs are grouped into three components through a factor analysis. Through the survey, nine factors are identified as critical to the success of labour-intensive sub-contractors, and these CSFs are grouped into three components viz, the managerial performance, financial performance, and labour-intensive specific factors. The findings of this study provide a good basis for labour-intensive sub-contractors to improve their success at project and organisational levels. The identified CSFs will also provide a solid foundation for future research into the key performance indicators and benchmarks for labour-intensive sub-contractors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

Understanding existing business model types is a crucial part of business model innovation since business model types represent the status of current business models and hint toward business model innovation. However, the classification of business model types has rarely been addressed in the construction industry, and existing studies have conceptually classified them using subjective decisions that have limitations on their use in business model innovation. We quantified the business models of 72 international construction contractors from 2009 to 2014 using measurable variables for business model components, including international diversification, regional diversification, industry diversification, product diversification, human resources, physical resources, financial resources, project types, and geographical regions. Then the quantified business models were classified into business model types using two-step cluster analysis, and the performance differences between them were examined in terms of profitability, growth, and market competitiveness. We also examined how the classified business model types can be used in the business model innovation process. The results suggest the existence of three business model types used by international construction contractors and indicate significant performance differences among them. Our findings provide useful references for senior-level managers of international construction contractors to understand their current business model positions and find effective ways to innovate their business models.","[Jang, Youjin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Song, Kwonsik] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Park, Moonseo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Ahn, Yonghan] Hanyang Univ, Sch Architecture & Architectural Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea","Ahn, Y (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Sch Architecture & Architectural Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea.",uzjang@gatech.edu; kwonsiks@umich.edu; mspark@snu.ac.kr; yhahn@hanyang.ac.kr,,,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning [2015R1A5A1037548]","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning (No. 2015R1A5A1037548).",,75,1,1,9,41,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Designers perform a major role in attaining the project goals and managing project complexity during production. The purpose of this paper is to examine the designers' performance as evaluated by the main participants: the client, the project consultant/manager and the main contractor, and to identify the main success factors of designer performance using the participants' evaluation. The study also aims to examine how the economic size of a project affects the project participants' assessment of the designer's performance. It is assumed that as the size of a project increases, so does the complexity of the project, which will affect the scope of work and demands on the designers' operational performance for the specific project level. Design/methodology/approach - The Finnish project evaluation and benchmark database was used in this study as empirical data. The quantitative data consists of surveys on the project level and are based on a multi-dimensional standard evaluation wherein the main participants evaluate each other's performances. The client, project consultant and main contractor evaluated the designer's performance. The data of the study consisted of a total of 892 evaluations. ANOVA analysis was used to examine the differences between the project participants' assessments based upon the different economic sizes of the projects. Findings - Contractors were satisfied with the designers' performance in small projects, whereas the client and the project consultant/manager rated the designers' performance most successful in large projects. This result may be due to small projects are typically simple and less complex, in which case design solutions are generally well-defined. Nonetheless, the participants' level of satisfaction follows the same factors. The main problems in the designers' performance were related to the design content: the flawlessness and comprehensiveness, as well as the compatibility and consistency of designs. These factors were emphasized particularly in the client's low satisfaction of the designer's performance. However, project participants were satisfied with the collaboration with designers; however, room for improvement could be found in internal communication and collaboration within the design teams. The findings illustrated that the assessment of the success rate of a project was party-specific, which was clearly affected by the size of the project, as large projects appeared to be more complex than smaller ones. Practical implications - The findings suggested that there is a need to develop project-specific practices in managing multidisciplinary design teams. Additionally, particularly in large projects, designers should focus more on solving problems and design requirements occurring at the construction site. However, this should be implemented in such a way that this does not interfere with the design activities conducted with the client and project management. While client satisfaction is low in the small projects, designers should focus more on customer-oriented methods to serve client needs better. Originality/value - In construction project management studies, there is a need to measure the importance that various participants assign to different success factors. Since project success factors depend on project type, a more project-specific approach is suggested to identify the main parameters for measuring project success. This study provides a holistic approach of the designers' performance, which contributes to the theory of project success and designers' performance improvement.","[Karna, Sami; Junnonen, Juha-Matti] Aalto Univ, Espoo, Finland","Karna, S (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Espoo, Finland.",sami.karna@aalto.fi,,"Junnonen, Juha-Matti Kalevi/0000-0001-7538-8386",Finnish Construction Quality Association (RALA),The authors wish to thank Finnish Construction Quality Association (RALA) for their support and collaboration for the reported study.,,51,17,17,1,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Working within the parameters of worker safety awareness and behavior, many researchers have recently suggested that shared values and customs, i.e., group norms, play an important role in shaping individual workers' safety behavior. Regarding how individuals' behavior is under the influence of group norms, the social identity theory suggests that people perceive themselves as a member of a group, depersonalize the self, and base their beliefs and behavior on the norms of the group. Despite the clarity of this configuration, the extent to which construction workers' safety attitudes and behaviors are influenced by group norms, and the degree to which social identification is involved in this process, remains unclear. In particular, the transient nature of construction worker employment and multiple identities that a construction worker might hold make it difficult to understand the influence of group norms on workers' safety behavior. To address these knowledge gaps, this paper aims to identify the (1) influence of group norms on a construction worker's personal standards regarding safety behavior, (2) current status of construction workers' social identities, and (3) impact of social identification on the influence that group norms have on construction workers' personal standards regarding safety behavior. To achieve these objectives, empirical data were collected from 82 construction workers and nine project managers from three different construction sites using behavioral economic experiments along with surveys, and the data were analyzed using quantitative methods, such as correlation analysis, regression analysis, and t-tests. The analyses demonstrate that there is a measurable difference between construction workers' personal standards and the norms desired by project managers regarding safety behavior and that construction workers' personal standards regarding safety behavior are significantly influenced by their perceived group norms. The analyses also demonstrate that construction workers identify themselves with the different groups to which they belong (e.g., workgroup, trade, union, company, project) to significantly different degrees and that the salience of social identity with a group moderates the influence that the group's norms have on personal standards regarding safety behavior in construction workers. These findings suggest a new way of thinking about safety management in construction; promoting project-wide positive norms combined with improved project identity can be an effective means of improving workers' safety behavior in construction projects.

Although subcontracting is a usual phenomenon in the construction industry, insufficient attention to the subcontractor selection strategy may pose some major threats to a project. Having in mind the significance of such risks, the optimization of subcontractor selection is essential for the success of the project. The importance of risk management in selecting subcontractors and the direct relation between risks and returns in most projects are two main motives for using the concept of portfolio in this paper. The main objective of this paper is to propose a model to allocate the best portion of project's task to some subcontractors in order to reach the optimized portfolio of subcontractors and main contractor. This is a new approach in the subcontractor management; therefore, after presenting the model, an illustrative example will be presented for better understanding.","[Abbasianjahromi, Hamidreza; Rajaie, Hossein; Shakeri, Eghbal; Kazemi, Omid] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, 424 Hafez Ave, Tehran, Iran","Abbasianjahromi, H (corresponding author), Amirkabir Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, 424 Hafez Ave, Tehran, Iran.",abasian.hamid@gmail.com,,"Abbasianjahromi, Hamidreza/0000-0003-3249-2882",,,,22,9,9,0,37,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

This paper presents findings about emerging radio frequency (RF) remote sensing and actuating technology that can improve construction safety by warning or alerting workers-on-foot and equipment operators in a pro-active real-time mode once equipment gets too close in proximity to unknown or other equipment. A review is provided on the background and importance of safety related to various pieces of construction equipment. Pro-active real-time proximity and alert technology for daily construction operations is introduced to solve this problem. Results of various field experiments that tested the proximity and alert technology are presented. A discussion follows on how such technology can improve objective construction site safety data collection and lead to more effective construction workforce safety training and education.

Three participants are invited to involve in the indoor construction activities with working at height three times, and the participants' locations, postures, and video are recorded using sensing devices. The participants' risk levels are evaluated based on posture, location, and posture-location fusion respectively. A comparison of the risk level evaluated based on those three approaches and the ground truth provided by the experts. The results show that the accuracy of automatic safety risk level evaluation based on location and posture fusion is 83%, compared with 81% and 57% achieved by the single-feature based risk level evaluation using location and posture respectively.

Lean is an operations strategy prioritizing flow efficiency. In construction, empirical underpinning of operations strategies has been limited. The aim is to capture how perceptions of operations strategy in construction practice aligns with existing theories of operations strategy organized in decision categories. Nine in-depth interviews with contractor middle managers were transcribed and analyzed to capture their perceptions of operations strategies. Results show: (1) decision categories in construction differ from manufacturing, and (2) differences between resource and flow efficient operations strategies exist. A resource efficient strategy focuses cost and delivery as competitive criteria, while customer value is targeted in a flow efficient strategy. Proposed structural decision categories are standardization, organization and production planning, supply chain, and infrastructural decision categories are human resources, continuous improvement, long-term perspective, process vs. project, and performance measurements. Infrastructural categories are more difficult to replicate and render competitive advantage if successfully aligned with business strategy. An operations strategy strictly focused on project delivery, such as lean construction, is not automatically aligned with the business strategy, but can achieve satisfactory project performance.","[Simu, Kajsa; Lidelow, Helena] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden","Lidelow, H (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",helena.lidelow@ltu.se,,,Swedish Construction Federation,The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the Swedish Construction Federation for financial support.,,62,3,3,5,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

This paper focuses on improving the selection of a design-build contractor by modeling the inherent uncertainties associated with open tendering. Although there are numerous methods for selecting a contractor, few consider, and even fewer have accounted for, random uncertainties associated with open tendering. In the absence of a structured approach that includes cognitive uncertainty modeling, the risk of choosing a subpar contractor and consequent project failure increases. Cloud theory uses a normal distribution membership function to infuse fuzzy set theory with probability theory. The application of cloud theory in a case study to order the preferred contractors improves decision-making quality and, consequently, confidence in the derived outcome where uncertainty exists. By accounting for both fuzzy and random uncertainties expressed by decision makers, this formulation for contractor selection increases the potential to achieve client performance goals. The proposed new approach reduces the risk of project failure by offering a unique understanding of how to more efficiently choose a design-build contractor. It narrows the model prediction and practice gap by providing an alternative to selecting the lowest bidder.","[Martin, Hector; Ramjarrie, Karrisa] Univ West Indies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Martin, Hector] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Dept Built Environm, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England","Martin, H (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Dept Built Environm, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England.",H.H.Martin@ljmu.ac.uk; karrisaramjarrie@gmail.com,,,,,,124,0,0,7,7,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The proposed model includes cost-objective function, generalized precedence relationship constraints, project duration restraints, logical conditions, and cost restrictions. The MINLP model allows inclusion of a wide variety of nonlinear expressions and provides the exact optimal output data for construction project management, such as a Gantt chart, histogram, and S-curve of total project cost. The novelty of the contribution is that the planner is now enabled to perform the exact optimal scheduling of project activities simultaneously with scheduling of nonlinearly restricted total project cost at each discrete working time unit. At this point, the restrictions can be set on increments and cumulative values of total project cost. A set of application examples is shown in this paper to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model.

Numerous time-cost trade-off approaches, such as mathematical, metaheuristic, and evolutionary methods, have been extensively studied in the construction community. Currently, the scheduling of a repetitive project is conducted using the traditional precedence diagramming method (PDM), which has two fundamental limitations: (1) progress is assumed to be linear from start to finish; and (2) activities in the schedule are connected each other only at the end points. This paper proposes a scheduling method that allows the use of continuous precedence relationships and piece-wise linear and nonlinear activity-time-production functions that are described by the use of singularity functions. This work further develops an adaptive multiple objective symbiotic organisms search (AMOSOS) algorithm that modifies benefit factors in the basic SOS to balance exploration and exploitation processes. Two case studies of its application are analyzed to validate the scheduling method, as well as to demonstrate the capabilities of AMOSOS in generating solutions that optimally trade-off minimizing project time with minimizing the cost of non-unit repetitive projects. The results thus obtained indicate that the proposed model is feasible and effective relative to the basic SOS algorithm and other state-of-the-art algorithms.","[Tran, Duc-Hoc; Luong, Duc-Long] Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Chou, Jui-Sheng] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Taipei, Taiwan","Tran, DH (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",tdhoc@hcmut.edu.vn,"Chou, Jui-Sheng/C-8795-2009","Chou, Jui-Sheng/0000-0002-8372-9934",Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [102.05-2018.07],This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 102.05-2018.07.,,71,15,15,2,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

In recent decades, with the rapidly increasing costs of new constructions, the effective maintenance has become more important to the existing buildings, particularly to their fabric components, which include both architectural and structural items for maintaining physical characteristics and ensuring normal performance of the existing building over its lifecycle. However, building maintenance costs are also increasing dramatically and this situation mainly results from the delay of maintenance work due to inefficient maintenance planning for the facility management purpose. The inefficient maintenance planning is caused due to lack of effective methods and techniques for predicting the uncertainties including schedule and costs during the maintenance stage. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative management workflow design which integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) with digital programming to implement efficient schedule and cost planning of building fabric maintenance. Through this BIM-based workflow design, the knowledge gap between maintenance theories and practical maintenance management can be narrowed by a consistent and sustainable building information flow, which is highly linked with the design and construction phase.

This, in turn, results in reducing the probability of completing the project on time and increases the risk of schedule delays. The objective of project management is to complete the scope of work on time, within budget in a safe fashion of risk to maximize overall project success. The purpose of this paper is to present an effective algorithm, named as adaptive multiple objective differential evolution (DE) for project scheduling with time, cost and risk trade-off (AMODE-TCR). Design/methodology/approach In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model for project scheduling is developed using DE algorithm. The AMODE modifies a population-based search procedure by using adaptive mutation strategy to prevent the optimization process from becoming a purely random or a purely greedy search. An elite archiving scheme is adopted to store elite solutions and by aptly using members of the archive to direct further search. Findings A numerical construction project case study demonstrates the ability of AMODE in generating non-dominated solutions to assist project managers to select an appropriate plan to optimize TCR problem, which is an operation that is typically difficult and time-consuming. Comparisons between the AMODE and currently widely used multiple objective algorithms verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the developed algorithm. The proposed model is expected to help project managers and decision makers in successfully completing the project on time and reduced risk by utilizing the available information and resources. Originality/value The paper presented a novel model that has three main contributions: First, this paper presents an effective and efficient adaptive multiple objective algorithms named as AMODE for producing optimized schedules considering time, cost and risk simultaneously. Second, the study introduces the effect of total float loss and resource control in order to enhance the schedule flexibility and reduce the risk of project delays. Third, the proposed model is capable of operating automatically without any human intervention.","[Duc Hoc Tran] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Luong Duc Long] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Tran, DH (corresponding author), Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",duchoc87@gmail.com,,,,,,48,12,12,0,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

However, few of the existing approaches to reviewing control measures take into account or effectively tackle these conditions. This paper introduces a three-level (i.e., individual hazards, hazard types, and generic hazards) hierarchical Bayesian model based on workers' responses to proximity warnings of safety hazards to address the problem. The proposed model distinguishes between two uses of proximity warnings (i.e., as the primary control measure and as the secondary measure), uses observational response rates as input, takes into account prior knowledge of workers' responses to similar hazards, and produces estimated response rates (ERRs). These ERRs are the primary indicator of the effectiveness of a given control measure as well as of the validity of a previously identified safety hazard. A 17-day field experiment was conducted to test the proposed approach, preliminarily using a location-based proximity warning system to warn workers of safety hazards and record their responses to warnings. The experimental results demonstrated the potential of the proposed approach. The limitations of the present analysis and the directions for future research are also discussed.

Minimizing project cost often results in additional project duration and might jeopardize quality, and minimizing project duration often results in additional cost and might jeopardize quality. Also, increasing construction quality often results in additional cost and time. The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze trade-offs among the project objectives of time, cost and quality. Design/methodology/approach The optimization model adopted a quantitative research method and is developed in two main steps formulation step that focuses on identifying model decision variables and formulating objective functions, and implementation step that executes the model computations using multi-objective optimization of Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms to identify the aforementioned trade-offs, and codes the model using python. The model performance is verified and tested using a case study of construction project consisting of 20 activities. Findings The model was able to show practical and needed value for construction managers by identifying various trade-off solutions between the project objectives of time, cost and quality. For example, the model was able to identify the shortest project duration at 84 days while keeping cost under $440,000 and quality higher than 85 percent. However, with an additional budget of $20,000 (4.5 percent increase), the quality can be increased to 0.935 (8.5 percent improvement). Research limitations/implications The present research work is limited to project objectives of time, cost and quality. Future expansion of the model will focus on additional project objectives such as safety and sustainability. Furthermore, new optimization models can be developed for construction projects with repetitive nature such as roads, tunnels and high rise buildings. Practical implications The present model advances existing research in planning construction projects efficiently and achieving important project objectives. On the practical side, the optimization model will support the construction industry by allowing construction managers to identify the highest quality to deliver a construction project within specified budget and duration, lowest cost for specified duration and quality or shortest duration for specified budget and quality. Originality/value The present model introduces new and innovative method of increasing working hours per day and number of working days per shift while analyzing labor working efficiency and overtime rate to identify optimal trade-offs among important project objectives of time, cost and quality.","[Wang, Tianqi] Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Abdallah, Moatassem; Clevenger, Caroline; Monghasemi, Shahryar] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Engn, Denver, CO 80202 USA","Abdallah, M (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Engn, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",moatassem.abdallah@ucdenver.edu,,,,,,35,5,5,12,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

There is some evidence that this is beginning to happen in the larger contracting and development enterprises in construction. The construction sector in most economies is still largely dominated by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). There has been little evidence of SCA being applied by SMEs. It is argued by some that such concepts are inapplicable to the SME segment of the construction industry. This case study documents the results of a strategic-planning workshop undertaken for an Australian project-management consultancy. The paper describes the background to the company and gives full details of the strategic-planning discussions and assessments made. These resulted in a business strategy being identified. The extent to which this strategy was implemented and whether it resulted in an SCA for the company is considered in light of events at the strategic-planning session. The result is a detailed example of the way that strategic-planning concepts can apply at the SME level and an evaluation of the extent of their success in implementation.,,"BETTS, M (corresponding author), UNIV SALFORD,DEPT SURVEYING,SALFORD M5 4WT,LANCS,ENGLAND.",,"Betts, Matthew/Q-2978-2019",,,,,12,7,8,0,19,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENG,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398",0742-597X,,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Therefore, it is desired to generate robust schedules in the sense of being insensitive to project disruptions, such as deviations in activity durations. Beyond that, efficient schedules that offer high robustness at a low cost are preferred. This paper focuses on the discrete time-cost tradeoff problem and develops a new method for identifying and ranking efficient schedules. First, a large schedule pool with robust schedules is generated. Efficient schedules are then identified and ranked by applying data envelopment analysis (DEA) with a particular super-efficiency model. An extensive evaluation based on a project testbed and an example construction project shows that the proposed method finds and ranks efficient schedules, that can be suitably presented to a project manager for decision support.","[Schmidt, Klaus Werner] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Hazir, Oncu] Rennes Sch Business, Dept Supply Chain Management & Informat Syst, F-35065 Rennes, France","Schmidt, KW (corresponding author), Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",schmidt@metu.edu.tr; oncu.hazir@rennes-sb.com,"schmidt, Klaus/ABB-8956-2020","schmidt, Klaus/0000-0003-3840-2737; Hazir, Oncu/0000-0003-0183-8772",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [SOBAG 113K245],This work was supported by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) under Grant SOBAG 113K245.

Multiple crews means that an activity can be performed simultaneously in several units by hiring additional crews, whereas fixed logic indicates that for each activity the units assigned to the same crew must be performed by a fixed construction sequence. Existing research works use heuristic methods to solve the problem without formulating an explicit model for further analysis. In this paper, we adopt the mixed-integer programming approach to construct an exact model. To handle large-size problems, an approximate model with reduced number of constraints and variables is further presented. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that the exact model is capable of finding optimal solutions for medium-size problems in a reasonable amount of time, and the approximate model produces good feasible solutions for large-size problems in an accepted length of time.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a multi-agent systems (MAS)-based contractor pre-qualification (CP) model for the construction sector in the frame of the tender management system. Design/methodology/approach - The meta-classification and analysis study of the existing literature on CP, contractor selection and criteria weighting issues, which examines the current and important CP criteria, other than price, is introduced structurally. A quantitative survey, which is carried out to estimate initial weightings of the identified criteria, is overviewed. MAS are used to model the pre-qualification process and workflows are shown in Petri nets formalism. A user-friendly prototype program is created in order to simulate the tendering process. In addition, a real case regarding the construction work in Turkey is analyzed. Findings - There is a lack of non-human-driven solutions and automation in CP and in the selection problem. The proposed model simulates the pre-qualification process and provides consistent results. Research limitations/implications - The meta-classification study consists of only peer-reviewed papers between 1992 and 2013 and the quantitative survey initiates the perspectives of the actors of Turkish construction sector. Only the traditional project delivery method is selected for the proposed model, that is other delivery methods such as design/build, project management, etc., are not considered. Open, selective limited and negotiated tendering processes are examined in the study and the direct supply is not considered in the scope. Practical implications - The implications will help to provide an objective CP and selection process and to prevent the delays, costs and other troubles, which are caused by the false selection of a contractor. Originality/value - Automation and simulation in the pre-qualification and the selection of the contractor with a non-human-driven intelligent solution ease the decision processes of clients in terms of cost, time and quality.","[Kog, Faikcan] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Construct Informat, Dresden, Germany; [Yaman, Hakan] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Architecture, Istanbul, Turkey","Kog, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Construct Informat, Dresden, Germany.",kog@itu.edu.tr,"Yaman, Hakan/P-8517-2016","Yaman, Hakan/0000-0002-1154-7189",Department of Scientific Research Projects of Istanbul Technical UniversityIstanbul Technical University [37266],The research work presented in this paper is part of the PhD project which is financially supported by the Department of Scientific Research Projects of Istanbul Technical University under project no 37266.

Identification of critical success factors (CSFs) allows one to reduce the vast number of factors to some manageable few but vital ones. Based on the CSFs, contractors' limited resources such as money and manpower can be allocated and aligned appropriately for yielding a maximum outcome of overall competitiveness. This paper describes the CSFs identified from a survey study carried out in Mainland China. The ranking analysis of the survey results shows that 35 factors are rated as critical for determining the competitiveness of a contractor. Factor analysis reveals that the 35 CSFs identified can be grouped into eight clusters, namely, project management skills, organization structure, resources, competitive strategy, relationships, bidding, marketing, and technology. The CSFs in this study provide a vehicle for guiding a contractor in managing its resources in order to improve competitive advantage. The study also provides insights into the management of competitiveness for contractors that are operating in the particular context of the Chinese construction industry.","[Lu, Weisheng; Shen, Liyin M.

The objective of this research is to explore and understand banks' perception on contractors' borrowing in Hong Kong through three stages. First, a framework that classified a set of criteria on loan application assessment was formulated. Second, a questionnaire survey was conducted to determine the key criteria by testing the theoretical framework with a number of banks. Third, a number of bankers were interviewed to explore the reasoning behind the tested framework. The paper presents findings on how banks have processed and evaluated contractors' loan applications. Further, similar lending policies adopted by international banks in Hong Kong would also be applied internationally. Accordingly, the findings would help contractors, not only in Hong Kong but also internationally, to find ways to enhance the success of their loan applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

Therefore, project owners must be conversant with the contractor's financial capability from the bidding stage through project completion. Consequently, project owners adopt a prequalification (PQ) process to screen for poor technical and managerial capabilities during the bidding stage. Although the PQ pass rate in Korea is nearly 99%, contractor liquidity can still pose problems. In this situation, the most important construction management strategy involves monitoring the contractor's liquidity status during the project. Accordingly, this study determines the symptoms of contractor decline at the corporate and project levels. Nineteen variables (17 financial and two nonfinancial) are selected through a symptom analysis. Moreover, this study develops a liquidity evaluation model (LEM) and its reference mode based on equations obtained by performing multiple discriminate analyses. These results demonstrate the practical feasibility of project owners to evaluate contractor liquidity using financial and nonfinancial information to prepare for possible financial problems.

To satisfy the foregoing objective, the Department of Rapid Transit System (DORTS) set the following criteria for tendering contracts. Civil works that did not require a high level of technology were channeled to domestic firms. More complex projects were assigned to private and government-owned companies that had accumulated a higher level of expertise because of joint ventures and their active involvement in international projects during the past three decades. The most technically challenging projects are given to international consortia in the form of either joint ventures or technical collaboration agreements with domestic companies.

This study developed and tested a theoretical model to investigate how different types of contractor behavior (perfunctory, consummate, and opportunistic) affect engineering project value added (EPVA) and analyze the moderating role of contract complexity and task complexity. The multiple regression analysis approach is used to analyze data collected from a survey of 290 Chinese project professionals. The results show that three types of contractor behavior have a significant impact on EPVA, that is, contractor perfunctory and consummate behaviors have a significant positive impact, whereas opportunistic behavior has a significant negative impact. In addition, contractor consummate behavior had the strongest impact, followed by perfunctory and opportunistic behaviors. The moderation results showed that the positive impact between perfunctory behavior and EPVA is strengthened and weakened by contract and task complexity, respectively, whereas the negative impact of opportunistic behavior is weakened and strengthened, respectively. The contract and task complexity have no significant moderating impact on the relationship between contractor consummate behavior and EPVA. The findings of this study contribute to the project governance and project performance literature and provide new knowledge for academe and practice for a deeper understanding of how to realize EPVA from the perspective of contractor behavior.","[Liu, Junying; Wang, Zhixiu] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Dept Construct Management, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Skitmore, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Yan, Ling] Tianjin Univ Technol, Coll Management, Dept Construct Management, 391 Bingshui West Rd, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China","Wang, ZX (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Dept Construct Management, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",liujunying@tju.edu.cn; 15222525060@163.com; rm.skitmore@qut.edu.au; 912223354@qq.com,"Skitmore, Martin/I-9743-2012","Skitmore, Martin/0000-0001-7135-1201",,,,83,13,13,11,87,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Knowledge management involves creating, securing, capturing, coordinating, combining, retrieving and distributing knowledge. Most know-what, know-how and experience exist only in the minds of individual participants during the construction phase of construction projects. The knowledge can be reused and shared among the engineers and experts involved who participate in projects in order to improve the construction process and reduce the time and cost of solving problems. Sharing and reusing knowledge depends on acquiring and preserving both tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge as the property of a corporation. Effectively using information and web technologies during the construction phase of a project enables knowledge to be captured and managed to the benefit of future projects. This study addresses application of knowledge management to construction projects in the construction phase and proposes a Construction Activity-Based Knowledge Management (ConABKM) concept and system for General contractors. This paper proposes the concept of integrating IDEF (Integrated DEFinition function modeling) modeling methods and provides a prototype used for designing construction knowledge management systems. The ConABKM system is then applied in a case study of a highway construction project; the results demonstrate the effectiveness of sharing knowledge in the construction phase. The combined results demonstrate that by utilizing the latest web technology, knowledge exchange and storage concepts and modes of implementation, a ConABKM system is an effective tool for all experts and engineers participating in the construction phase of a project.

A comprehensive construction value packaging system (CVPS) is presented for assisting these project leaders in improving the efficacy, efficiency, and transparency of this process. The CVPS comprises an interface-oriented approach to work decomposition and a multicriteria approach to contractor selection. Selection is supported by software for iteratively computing and interactively visualizing the Pareto front of optimal work packages. The CVPS is validated by functional demonstration and a case study of a piping installation project in an energy infrastructure facility. The initial Pareto front had more than 100,000 optimal work packages representing different trade-offs between cost, time, contractor experience, maintenance rates, and financial stability. An iterative and interactive process of query formulation and exact (not heuristic) evaluation helped the expert to focus in on solutions of interest and created a transparent and quantitative record of the decision-making process.

Our study examines the effects of safety behavior and physiological perceived control (PPC) on the relationship between safety knowledge and outcomes. We examined this relationship by focusing on the mediating role of safety behavior and the moderating role of PPC. We employed a time-lagged design to collect data. Field survey results from 385 site workers from construction sites in the Yangtze region of China show that safety behavior mediated the positive relationship between safety knowledge and outcomes. Furthermore, PPC strengthens the relationship between safety knowledge and safety behavior. The results indicate that workers' safety knowledge may not transform into expected safety behavior and performance if they experience low levels of PPC. These findings provide new insights into levels of PPC as a boundary condition for understanding the relationships among safety knowledge, safety behavior, and safety outcomes.

The replication strategies include database snapshots, materialized views, and quasi-copies. These strategies are 'static' and do not adapt to the changes in the data usage patterns. Furthermore, they often require expensive update synchronizations to maintain data consistency and do not exploit the knowledge embedded in the query history. This paper describes a machine learning based time invariant fragmentation method (MLTIF) that acquires knowledge about the data usage patterns for each node. Based on this knowledge, MLTIF designs time invariant fragments (TIF) and schedules its allocation and selective update for a specified time period. Simulation is used to compare the effectiveness of the MLTIF approach with that of full replication, materialized views, and non replication strategies.

Random-coefficients logistic model is used to explicitly measure the heterogeneity across contractors in terms of their (1) intrinsic bid/no-bid preferences and (2) responses to four bidding variables, i.e., number of bidders, market conditions, project type, and size. The binary bid/no-bid decisions were assumed to arise from a logistic model, but with the model parameters that varied between contractors. Data were gathered using a bidding experiment involving Hong Kong and Singapore contractors. The results show that there is significant heterogeneity across the contractors in which Hong Kong contractors can be clustered into four groups of identical (statistical) behavior in response to the four bidding variables, whereas in Singapore, there are only three groups as determined by the underlying heterogeneity distribution. This probabilistic classification of contractors has implications for contractors' competitive strategies by targeting different groups of competitors toward maximum competitiveness.","[Oo, Bee-Lan] Univ Sydney, Sch Civil Engn, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Drew, Derek S.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lo, Hing-Po] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Oo, BL (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Civil Engn, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",b.oo@civil.usyd.edu.au; bsdsdrew@polyu.edu.hk; mshplo@cityu.edu.hk,,,,,,42,23,23,1,10,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The specific objectives of this survey are to find out how the tacit and explicit knowledge are captured, stored, shared, and used in forthcoming projects, as well as major drivers and barriers for knowledge management. Based on the survey, it was determined that most of these firms do not have a knowledge management strategy and a systematic way of capturing and storing tacit knowledge. A conceptual framework is proposed to formalize the knowledge-capturing process within construction companies. To demonstrate how the conceptual framework can be implemented in practice, a Web-based system, namely, Knowledge Platform for Contractors (KPfC) is presented.

To address these objectives, this study uses naturally occurring news article data regarding construction safety in India. The paper discusses the safety of construction personnel, the safety of the project, and the safety of externalities. It was seen that safety was used strategically for branding, for political motives, as well as for awakening the community of the importance of construction safety. This study makes a case that safety management in construction is not just the prevention of accidents, but also impression management.

During the last three decades delays have occurred in most types of projects, from simple building projects to the most complex projects such as nuclear power plants or tunneling works. Generally, delays may be caused by: the client (compensable delays); the contractors (non-excusable delays); or acts of God or a third party (excusable delays). This paper classifies the main causes of non-excusable delays according to the source of occurrence, then identifies the factors contributing to those causes. It is assumed that the client has more control over the compensable delays and can take action to prevent them. The contractor is expected to have control over the non-excusable delays and, presumably, do more to prevent them. Several studies have discussed the issues relating to these delays, but no major study has been conducted to examine the causes of non-excusable delays in great depth. Understanding the underlying factors that contribute to causes of non-excusable delays would help in identifying and overcoming the problems faced by contractors during the construction process. To assist in identifying the factors contributing to causes of non-excusable delays, the Ishikawa or fish bone diagram has been used as an analytical tool, and a ranking methodology has been devised. As a report of initial findings of the study, which is currently being undertaken at Loughborough University, U.K., this paper identifies materials-, equipment-, and labor-related delays as major causes of contractors' performance delays.","Loughborough Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Bldg Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England","Majid, MZA (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Bldg Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",,"Abd.

We envisage that the emergence of information and communications technology (ICT) systems is of great use in effectively promoting safety and quality and exploiting the synergy between these two disciplines. The objectives of this research were to investigate the relationship between safety and quality through the application of ICT. A system of key safety and quality performance indicators was compiled in order to evaluate the potential benefits. Safety and quality leading indicators were recorded prior to and after intervention process using a mobile application for communication, control, and command of construction of safety and quality (C4). The results observed in the pilot study showed an improvement of 30% in quality and a reduction of 90% in unsafe activities during the implementation phase. These differences were tested using Student's t-test and found to be statistically significant at the level of 0.99. Integrated safety and quality leading indicators contributed to enhanced safety and quality and had a potential improvement of up to 90% in construction quality and up to 30% in construction safety.

However, humans often feel unsafe working alongside robots. Our knowledge of how to help humans overcome this issue is limited by two challenges. One, it is difficult, expensive and time-consuming to prototype robots and set up various work situations needed to conduct studies in this area. Two, we lack strong theoretical models to predict and explain perceived safety and its influence on human-robot work collaboration (HRWC). To address these issues, we introduce the Robot Acceptance Safety Model (RASM) and employ immersive virtual environments (IVEs) to examine perceived safety of working on tasks alongside a robot. Results from a between-subjects experiment done in an WE show that separation of work areas between robots and humans increases perceived safety by promoting team identification and trust in the robot. In addition, the more participants felt it was safe to work with the robot, the more willing they were to work alongside the robot in the future.","[You, Sangseok] HEC Paris, Dept Informat Syst & Operat Management, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France; [Kim, Jeong-Hwan; Lee, SangHyun; Kamat, Vineet] Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2350 Hayward, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Robert, Lionel P., Jr.] Univ Michigan, Sch Informat, 105 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA","Lee, S (corresponding author), Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2350 Hayward, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",you@hec.fr; kimjeo@umich.edu; shdpm@umich.edu; vkamat@umich.edu; lprobert@umich.edu,"Robert, Lionel/K-1961-2019","Robert, Lionel/0000-0002-1410-2601; Kamat, Vineet/0000-0003-0788-5588; Lee, SangHyun/0000-0002-2246-7440",University of Michigan MCubed research program,This study was supported by the University of Michigan MCubed research program.,,85,27,27,9,42,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Although valuable, traditional training experiences have not sufficiently addressed the issue of poor hazard recognition and management in construction. Since hazard recognition and management are cognitive skills that depend on attention, visual examination and decision-making, performance assessment and feedback in an environment that is realistic and representative of actual working conditions are important. The purpose of this paper is to propose a personalized safety training protocol that is delivered using robust, realistic and immersive environments. Design/methodology/approach Two types of virtual environments were developed: (1) Stereo-panoramic environments using real construction scenes that were used to evaluate the performance of trainees accurately and (2) A virtual construction site, which was used to deliver various elements of instructional training. A training protocol was then designed that was aimed at improving the hazard recognition and management performance of trainees. It was delivered using the developed virtual environments. The effectiveness of the training protocol was experimentally tested with 53 participants using a before-after study. Findings The results present a 39% improvement in hazard recognition and a 44% improvement in hazard management performance. Originality/value This study combines the benefits of using a virtual environment for providing instructional training along with realistic environments (stereo-panoramic scenes) for performance assessment and feedback. The training protocol includes several new and innovative training elements that are designed to improve the hazard recognition and hazard management abilities of the trainees. Moreover, the effectiveness of training in improving hazard recognition and hazard management is measured using specific outcome variables.","[Jeelani, Idris] Univ Florida, Rinker Sch Construct Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Han, Kevin; Albert, Alex] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Raleigh, NC USA","Jeelani, I (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Rinker Sch Construct Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",idris.jeelani@ufl.edu,,"Han, Kevin/0000-0002-2995-8381",,,,57,10,10,11,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

This was supplemented with a focus group approach to validate the framework. Findings A new framework for the management of external stakeholders is developed. It encompasses new features such as the dynamic identification of stakeholders at each project phase and their corresponding interests. Research limitations/implications The scope is road transportation projects in Nigeria and thus the recommendations may not be globally applicable. Practical implications The findings can help the public sector and their agencies to manage external stakeholders and maintain successful relationships on PPP projects. Originality/value The paper contributes to existing knowledge in four key areas: it confirms that the skill and actions of internal stakeholders are vital to the stakeholder management process; it shows that one-off stakeholder identification proposed in literature is a flawed approach; it proposes that the identification of external stakeholders' interests be dynamic; and it adds the perspective of low- and middle-income countries in stakeholder management in PPP projects.","[Amadi, Chika; Carrillo, Pat] Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Tuuli, Martin] Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm, Accra, Ghana","Carrillo, P (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough, Leics, England.",chiamadi@yahoo.com; p.m.carrillo@lboro.ac.uk; mtuuli@gimpa.edu.gh,,,,,,50,9,9,7,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

When making safety policy changes, legislative bodies and construction stakeholders alike try to successfully predict the impact such reformative actions will have on emergent safety patterns. Identifying optimal strategies for improving the market's safety climate is a difficult task to achieve given the complex interactions between the various parties involved. An agent-based model is developed and presented in this case study that mimics the interactions among project stakeholders at the market level within the context of construction safety during both bidding and construction phases. In addition to incorporating various behavioral patterns and financial attributes of contractors and owners, the model makes use of insurance premium models and government fines to simulate safety climate patterns at the project and market levels. The model is shown to be capable of realistically depicting emerging safety patterns in a given environment when reformative actions are initiated by various stakeholders. The model is promising as a tool for policy makers to identify optimal strategies for improving the market safety climate.

Previous studies have focused mainly on contractor prequalification from the owner's or consultant's perspective. There remains a need for a model to evaluate the contractor and project-specific aspects (i.e., project team and contractual risks) from the surety bonding perspective. This paper identifies and classifies the most relevant evaluation criteria that surety underwriters and brokers consider when evaluating a specific construction project for bonding purposes. Several data collection techniques (questionnaires, one-on-one interviews, and interacting group meetings), with highly experienced surety experts, were conducted to compile a comprehensive and detailed list of the evaluation criteria. Both fuzzy logic and expert systems are combined to develop a decision support system (DSS) for use in contractor and project evaluation. An approach for fuzzy membership function estimation is presented using a traditional membership function estimation technique, integrated with data of contractor prequalification cases. Thirty-eight alternative system configurations are investigated to determine the most accurate one. The system is validated using 32 prequalification cases, and the accuracy of the system is found to be 84.0%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The focus of BBS is on improving construction workers' safety behavior through feedback and increased self-awareness and motivation. Among the influencing factors of safety behavior, social norm is known to be a powerful mechanism that regulates workers' safety behavior. However, it is unclear how social norms are developed and through which process social norms influence an individual worker's safety behavior in construction projects. Additionally, the temporary and contract-based nature of employment in construction projects makes understanding the influence of different social norms on workers' safety behavior in construction projects especially difficult. Given this background, this paper aims to better understand the process by which different social norms exert control over construction workers' safety behavior. To achieve this goal, empirical data were collected from 284 workers from eight construction sites in the United States, Korea, and Saudi Arabia using surveys, and the data were analyzed. The results demonstrate that workers' safety behavior is influenced by perceived management norm, perceived workgroup norm, and personal attitude, and perceived workgroup norm mediates the relationship between perceived management norm and safety behavior. In addition, it is shown that social identification with the project intensifies the relationship between perceived management norm and safety behavior and attenuates the relationship between perceived workgroup norm and safety behavior. These findings contribute to the body of knowledge on construction safety by providing an explicative model for how social norms influence workers' safety behavior, and suggest that a sociopsychological approach to promote project identity and reinforce favorable social norms in construction workers can be an effective means of improving construction safety.

In the proposed model, there are three dimensions that determine risk significance (RS). The first is the risk attribute index (RA), which is related solely to the risk attributes (i.e., probability and impact). The second is the stakeholder attribute index (SA), which is related solely to the specific attributes of a stakeholder in a given project, including stakeholder salience (i.e., power, legitimacy, and urgency) and stakeholder position. The third is risk manageability (RM): a stakeholder's capability to proactively mitigate an individual risk that they will pose (i.e., in relation to its probability or impact), which is derived from the attributes of both the stakeholder and the risk. A real-world subway project was used to test the applicability of the model. To collect data, expert judgment was elicited and the consensus of opinions was tested. Application results demonstrated the model's capabilities in quantitatively assessing the attributes of a risk itself and the related stakeholder influences, and in prioritizing stakeholder-related risks based on their significance. Furthermore, based on the case study, a systematic process of the stakeholder-related risk management was designed for generic use and its improvements in general risk-management processes were analyzed. This study contributes to the research of risk assessment in construction projects by developing a model that is more suitable and accurate for assessing stakeholder-related risks because it incorporates previously underestimated stakeholder influences. Thus, this newly developed model improves traditional risk assessment that considers only risk attributes (i.e., probability and impact). It can also be applied to stakeholder-related risk assessment in other contexts, especially those with numerous stakeholders who pose complex risks.

High crowdedness can result in dangerous working conditions, negative workers' behaviors, lack of concern for safety climate, and productivity loss due to saturated and insufficient working areas where workers can perform. An automatic computer vision-based technique could be a novel solution for crowdedness monitoring for proactive safety management. Non-intrusiveness and applicability in a complex outdoor environment are critical considerations for device selection on construction sites. Accordingly, a red, green, and blue (RGB) camera is selected to detect worker-centric crowdedness. This device is less intrusive for workers than wearable sensors and is also widely applied in outdoor construction sites considering complex working areas and various light conditions. Previous RGB camera-based methods for crowdedness detection simplify the proximity estimation process by assuming that the construction site is a two-dimensional (2D) planar surface. These methods use image pixels for proximity calculation. Such simplification can cause a distortion in three-dimensional (3D) spatial proximity due to 2D projection of 3D entities. Moreover, previous methods suffer from lack of reproducibility due to the view variance of a 2D camera. To address these problems, a 3D spatial crowdedness estimation method is developed by generating a 3D space for proximity and crowdedness calculation from 2D video frames. This method has been validated in laboratory and field tests. Results indicate that the proposed method enables the estimation of 3D spatial proximity between two workers within an error of 0.45 m in a real-time and view-invariant manner from a 2D video. The proposed method is expected to enable managers to accurately monitor crowdedness among workers for proactive construction safety management.","[Yan, Xuzhong; Zhang, Hong] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Inst Construct Management, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yan, Xuzhong; Li, Heng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hung Hom,Kowloon, 11 Yuk Choi Rd, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China","Yan, XZ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Inst Construct Management, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Yan, XZ (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hung Hom,Kowloon, 11 Yuk Choi Rd, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China.",11512075@zju.edu.cn; jgzhangh@zju.edu.cn; heng.li@polyu.edu.hk,"Li, Heng/B-2821-2015","Li, Heng/0000-0002-3187-9041",Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of ChinaSpecialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP) [20130101110058],This project was supported by the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (No.20130101110058).

Onsite safety observers often assess workers' severity levels during construction activities. While risk analysis is key to improving long-term construction site safety, omnipresent monitoring is still time-consuming and costly to implement. The recent growth of visual data captured actively on construction sites has opened a new opportunity to increase the frequency of worker safety monitoring. This paper shows that a comprehensive vision-based assessment is the most informative to automatically infer worker severity level from images. Efficient computer vision models are presented to conduct this risk analysis. The method is validated on a challenging image dataset first of its kind. Specifically, the proposed method detects and evaluates the worker state from visual data, defined by (1) worker body posture, (2) the usage of personal protective equipment, (3) worker interactions with tools and materials, (4) the construction activity being performed, and (5) the presence of surrounding workplace hazards. To estimate the worker state, a multitasked recognition model is introduced that recognizes objects, activity, and keypoints from visual data simultaneously, taking 36.6% less time and 40.1% less memory while keeping comparably performances compared to a system running individual models for each subtask. Worker activity recognition is further improved with a spatio-temporal graph neural network model using recognized per-frame worker activity, detected bounding boxes of tools and materials, and estimated worker poses. Finally, severity levels are predicted by a trained classifier on a dataset of images of construction workers accompanied with ground truth severity level annotations. In the test dataset assembled from real-world projects, the severity level prediction model achieves 85.7% cross-validation accuracy in a bricklaying task and 86.6% cross-validation accuracy for a plastering task, demonstrating the potential for near real-time worker safety detection and severity assessment.

Design/methodology/approach A new theoretical framework of stakeholder influence strategies was proposed and applied. The research design is a multi-case study, comprising four cases in the construction industry in Vietnam. Findings Seven specific strategies were found, including inputs withholding, inputs compromising, communication, direct action, coalition building, conflict escalation and credibility building. When possessing project inputs, stakeholders can affect a project directly via a withholding or compromising strategy. Communication is available to those who have basic communicating skills; however, direct action is only employed by groups that include a large number of members. Objectors must have common interests or goals with their potential allies for using coalition building. Conflict escalation is restricted to communities having distinctive characteristics which can be used to create new problems sensibly, while credibility building is used by parties possessing adequate resources and expertise. Originality/value This study is one of the first investigations on stakeholder-attributes-related requirements for utilising influence strategies in projects.","[Tan Hai Dang Nguyen; Wood, Anthony] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Chileshe, Nicholas; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, NBERC, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Nguyen, THD (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",tan_hai_dang.nguyen@mymail.unisa.edu.au,"Nguyen, Tan Hai Dang/AAU-3320-2021; Chileshe, Nicholas/F-5482-2010; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen/F-4614-2013; Wood, Anthony/F-4675-2013","Nguyen, Tan Hai Dang/0000-0002-6333-4361; Chileshe, Nicholas/0000-0002-1981-7518; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen/0000-0001-9639-2624; Wood, Anthony/0000-0003-2206-1165",,,,72,2,3,7,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

All these can induce serious stress and lead to dangerous situations at work. Hence, to prevent CWs from injury, this study sets out to investigate the relationships between job stressors, stress, safety behavior, and accidents. A survey of CWs was carried out using statistical tools to analyze the data. Five job stressors, two different types of stress, and safety behavior among CWs were identified using factor analysis. The results of the correlation and regression analyses showed that (1) physical stress is predicted by job certainty, co-worker support, and safety equipment, while psychological stress is predicted by both supervisor support and job certainty; (2) supervisor support and physical stress predict safety behavior; and (3) the risk of accidents can be reduced by safety behavior, whereas a high level of job control increases it. Finally, several recommendations are made, including on-the-job training, stress-reduction programs, and appropriate employment policies, to enhance safety behavior and decrease the number of accidents on construction sites. This paper provides empirical support to and extends some accident-causation theories, and sets a base for further study regarding stress management for Hong Kong's construction participants working in Mainland China.

As one of the most important factors influencing subcontractor behavioral intentions, perceived justice from previous collaborative experience affects the willingness of a subcontractor to cooperate with a general contractor in the future. In this paper, a model is built based on social exchange theory to examine the relationship between justice perception, relationship value, and subcontractor willingness to cooperate (WTC). Analysis of data from 122 subcontractors demonstrates that distributive justice and interactional justice positively affect WTC, and relationship value from the general contractor partially mediates such effects. However, procedural justice does not significantly affect WTC. The study provides a new perspective for examining the internal mechanisms between subcontractor justice perception and WTC. The findings will also help general contractors understand how their behaviors affect subcontractor WTC, thus providing practical implications for subcontracting management.

To regulate workers' unsafe behavior, construction practitioners have mainly used formal controls (e.g.,penalties). However, the formal approaches may not be effective at eliciting desired behavioral changes in improving safety behavior. Therefore, recently, researchers have paid more attention to how unsafe behaviors are produced. In this regard, cognitive models of safety behavior and empirical evidence on social influence have been suggested. However, there is a noticeable paucity of research investigating the mechanism behind the link between cognitive process, social influence, site risk, and safety behavior. In this paper, an empirically based agent-based model that incorporates theoretical and empirical findings of the sociocognitive process of workers' safety behaviors is developed. The model is used to conduct experiments examining how the sociocognitive process interacts with safety management interventions (i.e.,strictness and frequency of management feedback, and project identification) and influences workers' safety behaviors across different site risk conditions (i.e.,low-, modest-, and high-risk conditions). The results demonstrated that all three interventions contribute to decreasing the incident rate. Also, the interaction effects of the interventions in different site risk conditions were found using the parameter sweeping. The results indicated that (1)promoting workers' project identification would be an effective strategy in the modest-risk site condition; (2)other interventions should be combined after achieving the medium strictness of management feedback in the high-risk site condition; and (3)other interventions would not be effective without very strict management feedback in the low-risk site condition. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge on construction safety by extending the authors' understanding of the role of sociocognitive process and its interaction with the environment in shaping workers' safety behaviors. Additionally, the experiment results are expected to lay a strong foundation for developing effective safety management interventions in the construction projects.","[Choi, Byungjoo; Lee, SangHyun] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2350 Hayward St,GG Brown Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Lee, S (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2350 Hayward St,GG Brown Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",bjoochoi@umich.edu; shdpm@umich.edu,"Choi, Byungjoo/H-9576-2016","Choi, Byungjoo/0000-0002-3904-4305; Lee, SangHyun/0000-0002-2246-7440",University of Michigan from a Rackham Predoctoral FellowshipUniversity of Michigan System,The authors thank Professor Patrick Grim from Center for the Study of Complex Systems at the University of Michigan for his valuable and constructive suggestions during the validation process.

This study aims to test such belief by comparing the list of worker safety risks identified by site supervisors for both onsite and offsite construction scenarios for the same building components. Specifically, Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS)-prejob hazard assessments required by law in Australia-were collected from two projects where offsite manufacturing has been used, and they were used as a basis for the investigation. Additionally, interviews were conducted with the site supervisors who developed the Statements for a more in-depth investigation of the worker safety risks involved with onsite and offsite construction methods, respectively. The analysis reveals that the total risk score (the higher the score, the more numerous the safety risks) would decrease in the offsite construction scenarios in each case, mainly due to significantly fewer work-at-height tasks included in the offsite construction scenarios. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing an empirical, evidence-based explanation for why offsite construction can help reduce safety risks on construction sites.

Migrant workers face several barriers, including language and communication difficulties, which have obvious implications for the management of health and safety (H&S). This paper examines the effectiveness of pictorial aids for communicating hazards and controls to migrant workers on construction sites. A lexicon of critical H&S terms was developed through content analysis of worker induction guidance. A pictorial inventory of images was developed, tailored to the lexicon. The images were tested for comprehension among 50 migrant workers. A threshold of 85% correct interpretations of each image was set. 23 images failed and were altered before retesting to satisfactory levels. Workers from European countries identified more images correctly than workers of African and Indian origin. Workers with less than 5 years' experience scored lower than more experienced workers. Pictorial aids can communicate simple hazards and controls. Cultural differences may distort comprehension. Images should supplement existing communication methods, not substitute them.

COs of 95 new public school building projects contracted by the Clark County School District (CCSD) of Nevada were analyzed to quantify the cost and schedule growth as well as to determine the effect of COs on cost and schedule growth. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected from CCSD through questionnaire survey. Descriptive statistics and statistical tests were conducted to determine the effect of COs on cost and schedule growth. Findings It was found that the average amount of COs as well as cost and schedule overruns were 5.9, 3.0 and 7.4 percent, respectively. Statistical tests showed that the amount of COs had an adverse effect on schedule growth; schedule overruns in projects with less than 4 percent COs were significantly lower than projects with more than 4 percent COs. Cost overruns did not significantly differ in those two types of projects. The primary contribution of this study is that it provides the tools and the framework for school district engineers to determine the probability of the occurrence of COs as well as the optimum percentage of COs for a minimum effect on cost and schedule growth of new public school buildings. Probability curves were also developed to determine the likelihood of the occurrence of COs, cost growth and schedule growth in these projects. These findings could be used by school districts to avoid or reduce COs in future projects, minimizing the effect on cost and schedule growth during the construction phase. Research limitations/implications - The findings and the probabilities curves developed in this study should be used carefully in other cases. These data were specific to the owner, location and types of buildings and generalizing these findings may have negative consequences. Practical implications - The practical implications are that this study could provide a tool to school building administrators to determine the probability of having COs as well as cost and schedule overruns and the effects of COs on cost and schedule overruns. To the authors' best knowledge, no other studies of this type have been conducted previously. Social implications The social implication of this study is it will help to efficiently use the tax payers' money while building new school buildings. Originality/value This study has collected the hard data of COs, cost and schedule data of CCSD new school building projects. Therefore, the data are from the projects completed by CCSD. So, the paper is written from the original data received from CCSD.","[Shrestha, Pramen P.; Shrestha, Kabindra Kumar; Zeleke, Haileab B.] Univ Nevada, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Construct, Howard R Hughes Coll Engn, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA","Shrestha, PP (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Construct, Howard R Hughes Coll Engn, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",pramen.shrestha@unlv.edu,,"Shrestha, Pramen/0000-0001-6362-2315",,,,33,6,6,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

In this research, the causes of contractors' claims in international EPC projects are modeled and empirically tested with industry survey, structural equation modeling and case studies from the perspective of Chinese contractors. The established model outlines the causes of contractors' claims as: external risk (sociopolitical risks, economic risks, and natural hazards), clients' organizational behavior (untimely payment, change orders, and inefficient processing), and project definition in contract (unclear scope of works, and unclear technical specification). The structural equation modelling validates that these causes have direct influences on claim respectively. Besides, clients' organizational behavior acts as a partial mediation between external risk and claim, demonstrating that external risk can also exert influence on claim through affecting clients' organizational behavior. Seven case studies further confirmed and interpreted the substantive meaning of these relationships. This study establishes interdisciplinary linkages among knowledge areas of contracting, risk management, organizational behavior, and international EPC project delivery, which has important primary contributions in both theory and practice. Understanding how the fundamental factors interactively lead to claims can help contracting parties to develop effective claim strategies, proactively mitigate project risks, and ultimately improve EPC project performance.","[Shen, Wenxin; Tang, Wenzhe; Yu, Wenyang] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Project Management & Construct Technol, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, New Hydraul Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Duffield, Colin F.; Hui, Felix Kin Peng] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Wei, Yongping] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Fang, Jun] Sinohydro Bur 7 Co LTD, Chengdu 610081, Peoples R China","Tang, WZ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Inst Project Management & Construct Technol, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, New Hydraul Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",twz@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Hui, Felix Kin Peng/T-3752-2018; Duffield, Colin F/E-7522-2015","Hui, Felix Kin Peng/0000-0002-4800-9130; Duffield, Colin F/0000-0001-6497-7759","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51379104, 51579135, 51079070, 50539130, 70671058]; State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering [2013-KY-5, 2015-KY-5, 2009-ZY-7]; Major Science and Technology Research Project of Power China [DJ-ZDZX-2015-01-02, DJ-ZDZX-2015-01-07]","The work described in this paper was supported by a grant from/ Many thanks are given to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51379104, 51579135,51079070, 50539130 and 70671058), State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering (Grant Nos. 2013-KY-5, 2015-KY-5, 2009-ZY-7), and Major Science and Technology Research Project of Power China (Grant Nos.

A review of international safety regulations suggest that lack of oxygen and temperature extremes contribute to make these work environments hazardous. Building Information Modeling (BIM) platform has the potential to provide improved visualization for effective monitoring of confined spaces on construction sites. In an attempt to reduce Health and Safety (H&S) hazards, this work reports upon an integrated solution based on BIM and wireless sensor technology. A literature review has led to conceptualize a model for a BIM based technology application. This was later shaped into a scenario through industry feedback followed by a prototype development as a proof of concept. The prototype system uses BIM to present data received from wireless sensors placed at confined spaces on a construction site. Industry feedback on the prototype indicates that the proposed solution will facilitate intelligent monitoring of confined spaces through real-time sensor data to avoid time sensitive emergency situations typically encountered by workers operating in such work environments.

This study raises several limitations of the type-based system: a broad level of control, a distributed approach to cost and schedule data, ad hoc management, and difficulty in deriving meaningful data. Integrated cost and schedule control promises a myriad of benefits on both information flow and construction management. Nevertheless, the integrated approach still seems to be a long way from common use in the construction industry because it requires considerable overhead effort to acquire, track, and analyze the integrated data. The objective of this study is to propose a new method to automate the required processes for implementing cost and schedule integration. We propose an operational-level automatic data processing system for cost and schedule integration. The proposed system consists of a real-time location system for detecting equipment locations, a wireless mesh network for transmitting the location signals to a field office, and a prototype model for transforming the signals to cost and schedule data. Technical feasibility is analyzed through a pilot project. The study offers a new approach to facilitating sensor technologies for cost and schedule integration.","[Cho, Daegu; Cho, Hunhee] Korea Univ, Sch Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Daewon] Samsung C&T Corp, Dept PLM Innovat Grp, Seoul, South Korea","Cho, H (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Sch Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Seoul, South Korea.",hhcho@korea.ac.kr,"Cho, Hunhee/D-2662-2013",,Korea Institute of Construction and Transportation Technology Evaluation and Planning (KICTEP) [09CCTI-B052843-01],This study is part of a research project sponsored by the Korea Institute of Construction and Transportation Technology Evaluation and Planning (KICTEP) under the Grant No. 09CCTI-B052843-01.

To unify the approach for such evaluation, the intent of this paper is to assess the evaluation approaches used by a variety of building owners and then focus on the main criteria used for the evaluation. To achieve this objective, this study is divided into two phases. The first phase includes a review of literature on the main criteria that can be used to evaluate maintenance contracts, followed by interviews with building owners and maintenance contractors to modify and update the criteria obtained from this review. The result of this phase is grouped into eight major categories. Each category involves a detailed list of the criteria used for the evaluation. The main categories include providing proper planning and scheduling; procuring materials for the site; providing suggestions on cost cutting; providing safety precautions at the building site; subcontracting control; and ensuring management efficiency, equipment availability, and man-power competence. The second phase consists of developing and then distributing a questionnaire for both building owners and maintenance contractors to rank the importance of each one of the detailed criteria indicated in the first phase of the study. The results of this survey indicate the significance of the criteria that should be used to evaluate contractors. Furthermore, the study indicates that owners and maintenance contractors generally agree on the ranking of the importance of the performance criteria.","KING FAHD UNIV PETR & MINERALS,CONSTR ENGN & MGMT DEPT,DHAHRAN 31261,SAUDI ARABIA","AlHammad, AM (corresponding author), KING FAHD UNIV PETR & MINERALS,COLL ENVIR DES,BOX 22,DHAHRAN 31261,SAUDI ARABIA.",,"ASSAF, SADI/A-2348-2010; Al-Hammad, Abdul-Mohsen/F-5705-2015",,,,,7,22,22,0,0,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENG,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398",0742-597X,,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

However, studies increasingly found that contracts, albeit well written, might not be thoroughly implemented. This study aims to examine the impact of quality performance ambiguity on contractor's opportunistic behaviors in person-to organization projects and to investigate the mediating role of contract design and application. A questionnaire-survey of 265 dwelling fit-out projects was undertaken in China. The results showed that quality performance ambiguity has great impacts on project development as it hinders detailed contract drafting, results in ineffective contract application and leads to opportunism. The mediation results showed that contract application rather than the written contract mediates the effect of quality performance ambiguity on contractor's opportunistic behaviors. Thus, it is recommended that project managers should pay attention to project characteristics and the gaps between the design and application of contracts in project management.

Based on a two-phase filtering approach, which included journal relevance assessment and article relevance assessment, 137 published papers within 22 journals were used for the study. The major finding was that the questions were raised on the suitability of selection criteria for appraising contractors and it was acknowledged that, choosing appropriate contractor selection criteria are affected by other factors hence can be regarded as a Multiple Criteria Decision Making problem suitable for machine learning tools. A major limitation of was that, even with the 137 reviewed papers, not all contractor selection-related papers were reviewed.

Likewise, trust is argued to improve the inter-organizational relationships among principal actors in project development, such as contractors, owners, and suppliers.

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the WLB of QSs working in Sri Lanka. A literature survey was first conducted and its findings were validated using 12 expert interviews through which additional information specific to QSs was also gathered. The findings of a questionnaire survey conducted subsequently among 115 professionals were ranked using Factorial ANOVA. WLB of QSs is found to depend on their gender and experience and deadlines is found to be its most influencing factor. Stress is one significant consequence of poor WLB. Yoga and meditation are found to minimize stress and other consequences of poor WLB. Factors affecting WLB can have a high impact on the technical and business cultures of organizations.","[Panojan, P.] Link Engn Pvt Ltd, Dehiwala, Sri Lanka; [Perera, B. A. K.

The collective results of these studies are difficult to interpret because the studies extend over decades and some show mixed results as to which delivery method offers superior performance. This paper analyzes the current literature on the three most widely used project delivery methods, and combines the quantitative findings for five performance metrics: cost growth, unit cost, schedule growth, delivery speed, and quality. By combining these results, this paper considers a much larger data set of projects, which leads to more representative results and further confidence in the conclusions. The quantitative results from 30 existing studies representing 4,623 projects are combined, their methodologies are compared and contrasted, and are ordered chronologically to highlight temporal trends. Combining the results from current literature and weighting the findings using each study's sample size shows that DB is the most effective in controlling cost growth (+2.8%) as compared with CMR (+5.8%) or DBB (+5.1%). No single delivery method consistently performs better on unit cost. CMR and DB were found to be the most accurate in controlling the schedule variation of a project, with an average schedule growth of +10.2 and +10.7%, respectively, as compared with a much higher +18.4% for DBB. Moreover, DB was found to be superior in delivery speed in all explored studies and continues to increase its advantage over time. The study also highlights methodological inconsistencies in the construction literature, which could be standardized to provide more comparable results among future studies. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by analyzing two decades of project delivery systems literature to compare the cost, schedule, and quality performance of DB, CMR, and DBB delivery systems.

As projects continue to grow in complexity, project management continues to evolve. Contractor selection is a difficult task that owners and project managers face. Although previously researchers have worked on the subject of contractor selection, a comprehensive decision support system for contractor selection has not yet been developed. Recent reports of major delays and cost overruns in mega projects highlight the need for a model that is able to be flexible and comprehensive becomes evident. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The research focuses on obtaining insights from field experts using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Then, a model was developed in the light of the data collected. Accordingly, the model was tested on a case study. Findings - This paper presents a model for contractor selection that is wholesome in its take on the topic. The model incorporates both managerial and technical aspects of the problem. The model was tested on a case study and it was proven to be feasible in real world applications. The contractor selection decision support system serves the needs of both academics and industry managers, as an integral part of project management. Originality/value - The model presented in this paper is innovative in its take on the problems. MCDA tools have been uniquely modified in this paper to cater to the needs of the selection problem while accounting for the criteria hierarchy that incorporates aspects that are instrumental for proper evaluation of a contractor's likelihood of success.","[Semaan, Nabil] Univ Balamand, Dept Civil Engn, Qalhat, Lebanon; [Salem, Michael] Univ Balamand, Dept Engn Management, Qalhat, Lebanon","Salem, M (corresponding author), Univ Balamand, Dept Engn Management, Qalhat, Lebanon.",michaelpsalem@gmail.com,"Semaan, Nabil/K-3271-2019; Salem, Michael/J-8769-2019","Salem, Michael/0000-0002-7059-8541; Salem, Michael/0000-0002-9991-2207",,,,30,26,26,3,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

The main contribution of this paper is in presenting a methodology to integrate an FES with adaptation/optimization techniques and applying the data-based adaptive learning concept to increase the accuracy of an FES developed for contractor default prediction for surety bonding. In addition, this paper investigates two optimization approaches (genetic algorithms and neural network back-propagation) for adaptation of fuzzy membership function (MBF) and rules' degree of support (DoS) to determine the most suitable technique to adapt the FES. The optimized FES, called SuretyQualification, was validated using 30 hypothetical contractor default prediction cases, and the highest accuracy of the system (adapted using neural networks) was found to be 91.83%. Another contribution of this paper is the development of a software tool called SuretyQualification that provides a comprehensive and systematic evaluation process to evaluate a contractor and their risk of default on a project. The presented optimization approaches address FES context adaptation using any changing information conveyed by the input-output data and provide a methodology for continuous adaptation of the FES parameters, using practical cases to adjust the FES according to any contexts changes.

A proposed simple additive weighted scoring (SAWS) model was used to generate importance weights of bidding factors and subjective importance scoring of internal (firm-related) and external (project-related and environment-related) factors affecting the bid or no-bid decision for a given bidding situation. Conclusions of contractor bid or no-bid decision behavior from the questionnaire study were corroborated with a semistructured interview study involving senior industry players deemed more familiar with real-life bid or no bid decision problems. Medium-to-large-sized contractors with high bid-win rates were found to have an importance scoring of internal factors not exceeding 50% of the importance scoring of external factors, whereas small contractors with high bid-win rates were found to have an importance scoring of internal factors not exceeding 45% of the importance scoring of external factors and hence offering quantitative criteria for when to pursue a bidding opportunity (bid) or not to pursue a bidding opportunity (no bid) on a new job in the studied contract construction market. The proposed bid or no-bid decision-support model was found to be 86% effective in predicting the actual decisions in 35 real-life bid or no-bid situations in a test study of the model in the Malawian contract construction market. The primary value of this study is the development of an effective and reliable tool for quantifying bid or no-bid decisions that is functional for any studied contract construction market with the potential to facilitate contractors' establishing in-house procedures and managerial decision support systems likely to improve the quality of decision-making in the construction industry.

Activities associated with these phases demand energy and other resources, which impose a burden on the environment. Therefore, every phase must be explored to minimize the energy requirements of each building project. There is a pressing need for sustainable projects in this highly competitive market. Demand is continually growing for contractors to innovate and incorporate measures to reduce energy consumption and the associated environmental impact of their operations. This study focuses on the energy consumed during the construction phase of buildings. It proposes a framework to assist contractors in estimating and recording such energy consumption. The tool, Contractor's Energy Information System (CEIS), was developed to aid in this endeavor. The tool was applied on a three-story office project to demonstrate the concept's utility. This study demonstrates that although default data can estimate overall energy consumption, project-specific data can better quantify and map energy consumption.

Problems such as poor communication, mistrust, lack of cohesion, and adversarial relationships among project stakeholders are often found in construction projects. Previous studies have explored the formation of successful interfirm networks in construction and investigated how to solve the aforementioned problems by means of a networking approach. It is therefore important to gain a clearer understanding of whether such a built network is effective and can contribute to construction management. Investigation of parameters for measuring the performance of interfirm networks has attracted the interest of many researchers and practitioners in industry and business fields. However, seldom has similar research been conducted in the field of construction management. This paper presents key parameters for measuring networking performance within the construction context. Five parameters are applied in the formation of the measurement model, including information exchange between project members, project communication system, knowledge-sharing for collaboration, corporate culture for promoting networking, and learning capability in intra- and inter-organizational settings. The empirical results of this study enable contractors to realize what items determine the performance of interfirm networks, and what aspects of construction management practices should be emphasized to improve the networking performance effectively.

The cost of quality (COQ) can help to achieve this balance. COQ in construction projects are dynamic in nature and hence should be considered as a complex interrelated system rather than a set of separate individual factors. This research aims to model the complex system of cost of quality and present policies for the reduction of those costs in construction projects. To implement the proposed model, the system dynamics approach is used to determine the impact of prevention and failure costs on the COQ and to analyze designed policies. The qualitative model is created through the causal loop diagrams (CLD) and is analyzed quantitatively using the system dynamics approach for a case project. According to the research results, an increase in training hours and employing experienced labors will decrease the failure cost and will increase the prevention costs, resulting in a reduction in cost of quality. However, based on the simulation results, the use of labor with a higher work experience will provide the largest decrease in the cost of quality.","[Shafiei, Iman; Eshtehardian, Ehsan; Arabi, Shiva] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Project Management & Construct Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Nasirzadeh, Farnad] Deakin Univ, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Geelong, Vic, Australia","Eshtehardian, E (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Project Management & Construct Dept, Tehran, Iran.",eshtehardian@modares.ac.ir,,"Nasirzadeh, Farnad/0000-0003-0101-6322",,,,70,2,2,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

These contracts transfer performance-related risks to contractors with the objective of reducing the total cost of maintenance over the pavement life cycle by leveraging on the efficiencies of private sector management. In such contractual settings, transportation agencies hedge their exposure to poorly performing pavements that require frequent attention. However, this comes with a price. Contractors price in their bids a premium to account for such scenarios. This paper presents a model for contractors to determine optimal management strategies by taking into account the inherent spatial variability in pavement's structural characteristics. The model considers a tradeoff between economies of scale associated with managing longer pavement sections and the risk reduction benefits with managing relatively smaller, e.g., more homogeneous sections. The results indicate that the length of optimal management sections depends not only on the expected contract penalty costs (disincentive costs), but also the ability of the contractor to explore economies of scale. The model is illustrated using typical data available to transportation agencies.","[Kim, Seok; Damnjanovic, Ivan; Gunby, Molly] Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Damnjanovic, I (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",kimseoksaroi@tamu.edu; idamnjanovic@civil.tamu.edu; mgunby@neo.tamu.edu,,,,,,31,6,6,0,12,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

These projects enhance public convenience, and are complex and uncertain, involving multiple governmental organizations. The critical success factors (CSFs) of these projects have been identified and prioritized from a main contractors' perspective, to enable project managers to prioritize their efforts and concerns. This study sheds light on CSFs in subway construction projects and contributes to the project delivery success literature with an overarching focus on the contractors' perspectives. Our investigation revealed that, for subway construction projects in Iran, goal setting through clear and realistic project goals, project management competency, competent project team, good cultural fit, top management support and adequate funding throughout the project are the top-ranking CSFs. An extensive body of literature is reviewed, and 140 potential success factors are identified. Then, a focus group has been conducted in which the potential CSFs reduced to 39 success factors. The priorities and ranking of the success factors were evaluated according to the views of 63 project managers of subway projects. The correlation coefficients analysis was used to analyze the results, and it revealed that 23 success factors such as goal setting, top management support and PM competency were perceived to be critical by the respondents. No other research has, until now, found the critical factors leading to success in subway construction industry in Iran.

At the same time, contractors should face a very competitive market situation. On the contractor side, in this way, there is a need for such a competitive contract price that could cover not only the cost of implementing the project work but those costs as well that are associated with financing the negative cash-flow balance period of the project work. Simultaneously, the contract price should cover some margin for contractors, while the amount of this margin is determined (beside the contract price and the actual cost) by the contractors' actual cash-flow balance to completion. Realising and considering this need, a comprehensive model has been developed by the author to plan and control contractor cash-flow associated with the project work. This model also enables contractors to elaborate such a bid price that satisfies the above mentioned needs while it forecasts the likely margin earned by the contractor. The copyrighted model allows planning and controlling contractor cash-flow in activity/time unit manner, and also in summarised forms, considering the entire project implementation process from the outset of the work till a specified reporting date. The term 'contractor' in this text implies all those project-based organisations that implement project work for project client organisations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

There has been no practical analytic model for objective determination of the most appropriate contractor selection method (CSM) before the tendering evaluation. Most existing models adopt the posttendering bidding data for a specific procurement project rather than those from all potential bidders who may enter the procurement market. To resolve the long-unsolved problem of the existing models, this paper proposes a pretendering contractor selection analysis model (PreCSAM) based on historical procurement data, which can determine the most appropriate of the three prevailing contractor selection methods, e.g., lowest tender (LT), best value (BV), and prequalified lowest tender (PQLT). The three-stage model validation of the proposed method revealed that the proposed PreCSAM is able to suggest a CSM with 100% correctness compared with those reported in literature; it also achieved a high precision rate (94.12%) of market range prediction for a retrospective analysis of 23 public building construction projects from 2012 to 2018 procurements by the Construction and Planning Agency of the Ministry of Interior, Taiwan. Most importantly, the proposed PreCSAM overcomes the limitations of posttendering analysis of all existing methods in determining CSM.

The contribution of this paper to the body of knowledge is to analyze how the incorporation of CCCS may affect general contractors' present and future competitiveness through a case study in China. This paper analyzes the procurement of 158 building projects tendered in Beijing involving 2,071 local general contractors active in the market. The results show that (1) the contractors' CCCS scores are important for being awarded large and mega project contracts; (2) CCCS scores have a generally positive effect on future corporate financial income; and (3) contrary to expectations, the policy does not increase the CCCS of companies. Finally, the changing trend in contractors' CCCS scores is observed to be highly correlated with their initial values (the scores of higher CCCS scoring companies increase faster on average than that of other companies). The final remarks address ways to better implement CCCS schemes in the future and avoid the potential risks involved in their use.

Those who design professionally are professional designers who see and seek value in new designs. Seeing and seeking might be done in two ways: narrower or broader. According to the approach characteristic for design-methodological reductionism, those things that are designed are considered the designed objects. In this approach, the designer's task is limited to artifacts narrowly understood. Systemic design methodology describes that what is designed in terms of an object of design. In the domain of designing, like in any kind of human professional activity, two types of moral dimensions are identified: endo- and egzomorality. The first deals with the moral code of design activity, the second with social responsibility of what is done by professional designers. Both define elements of designer's accountability: first, in respect of truth and honesty in relation to the designer's product-a design, second, in respect to societal benefit and not harm, both in respect to relevancy of what is designed for practical use. Once, producing and teaching good science is the main tasks of scholars, those among the scholars who are involved in design science are responsible not only for producing good design science but also for educating designers as reflective practitioners conscious of what every designer should know about objects of design and ethics related to the profession.

All these incidents have led to the impression that the current system of awarding the contracts is inefficient in selecting the contractor capable of meeting the demands and challenges of present times and hence needs to be reviewed accordingly. Therefore, in an attempt to investigate the current situation of the Singapore construction industry a questionnaire survey was conducted for accruing the data required to identify the important contractor selection criteria (CSC) and to draw upon construction practitioners' opinions regarding the importance of those CSC in assessing the capabilities of the candidate contractors during the selection process. The research reported upon forms part of a larger study that aims to develop a computer-interactive multicriteria decision system for contractor selection involving identification of CSC for inclusion in the system, investigation of CSC preferences of construction practitioners, and establishment of weights for those CSC from their perceived importance determined through the questionnaire survey of Singapore construction practitioners. The study highlights that there are statistically significant differences in opinions regarding the degree of importance assigned to some CSC among public clients, private clients, and contractors. Findings from the study may act as an aid in improving the Singapore construction industry by helping construction clients identify multiple CSC apart from cost which should always be considered when assessing the capability of candidate contractors during the selection process, by assisting contractors in improving their attributes in line with clients' preferences and by facilitating Singapore construction clients and researchers to develop a contractor selection system capable of assessing multiple attributes of the candidate contractors so that the risk of the project failure due to the selection of an inappropriate contractor is minimized.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore 63978, Singapore","Singh, D (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore 63978, Singapore.",dsingh@pmail.ntu.edu.sg; clktiong@ntu.edu.sg,"Lee Kong, Robert Tiong/A-3750-2011",,,,,43,67,67,0,34,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

By analysing the data for several years as panel data, this study determines the extent of influence of changes in company characteristics on the defaults and exits. Design/methodology/approach - Using construction company evaluation (Keiei Jikou Sinsa or Keisin) data and by employing the panel binary logit random effect model, this study empirically analyses the construction industry. Findings - This study shows that defaulting and exiting companies have different characteristics. The result shows financial performance indicators, non-financial performance indicators and Keisin scores to significantly affect defaults and exits. In particular, this study finds non- financial performance indicators, such as whether a firm draws insurance, to significantly affect its likelihood to default or exit and the influence varies on the basis of insurance type. Originality/value - The feature of this study is that its analysis focuses not only on defaulting companies but also on exiting companies, defined as those that stop operating as prime contractors for public works but otherwise stay in business. In contrast to existing research, this study distinguishes between defaults and exits and analyses the factors that influence a firm following one of these two outcomes. Moreover, although Keisin data are usually used to determine whether companies qualify to enter bids for public works, they can be applied for an attribution analysis of corporate defaults and exits.","Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Social Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan","Konno, Y (corresponding author), Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Social Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",konno.yukiko@gmail.com,,,,,,31,2,2,1,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

The two main decisions they have to make are the project selection decision and the markup selection decision. This paper proposes a new optimization model that combines these two main decisions. It also takes into account the importance of eminence and previous works as the most important non-monetary evaluation criterion used by owners for evaluating bids. These factors combined with the two decisions make this model complex and nonlinear. To solve this model, a customized Genetic Algorithm is developed. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the result of the model is compared to the results of conventional models that only consider bidding markups. The comparison shows that considering eminence can increase the expected profit of the contractor to more than 25% under some evaluation criteria mindsets of the owner. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Contract time, lane rental, warranty, and quality of delivered product are examples of the key factors that indicate the contractor-expected performance. Literature on best value shows a need for analyzing the past performance of the contractor in similar jobs as an indicator of his/her qualification trend. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a methodology to incorporate quality of delivered product in the BV procurement system of asphalt construction. The paper uses past quality control (QC) testing results and utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability that the contractor gets full payment as an indication of qualification trend. The QC data were obtained from the Nebraska Department of Roads for a number of Superpave pavement projects. The results show the possibility of assigning a quality score for the contractor based on the past performance.

Contract managers (CMs) employed at contractor firms were interviewed regarding their role, the selection of the structural frame and how they perceived different options. The results show that CMs largely influence the selection of the structural frame in multifamily buildings, which are guided by the established concrete-based sociotechnical regime. The regime is maintained through cognitive rules regarding structural frame options and the alignment of skills of construction professionals. Because of their influence and their investments in the skills of construction workers, CMs make important contributions to maintain the regime and the concrete path dependency. Furthermore, the regime varies in strength in different locations. Some locations carry a strong norm to cast concrete frames on site. This makes it more difficult to deviate from the established practice. In other locations, wood-promoting initiatives have changed the cognitive rules associated with the regime. Nonetheless, the sociotechnical regime makes the selection of concrete structural frames beneficial. This prevents wood-framed multifamily buildings from entering common usage, even though such buildings can contribute to mitigating climate change.","[Hemstrom, Kerstin; Gustavsson, Leif; Mahapatra, Krushna] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Built Environm & Energy Technol, Vaxjo, Sweden","Hemstrom, K (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Dept Built Environm & Energy Technol, Vaxjo, Sweden.",kerstin.hemstrom@lnu.se,"Mahapatra, Krushna/AAG-9874-2020","Mahapatra, Krushna/0000-0003-4405-1056",Cefur; Ronneby Municipality; Vaxjo Municipality; Vaxjohem; VEAB; Swedish Energy AgencySwedish Energy Agency,"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Cefur, Ronneby Municipality, Vaxjo Municipality, Vaxjohem, VEAB and The Swedish Energy Agency and the helpful comments from Ole Jess Olsen.",,42,19,19,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

The Turkish construction industry is not different from the global construction industry in the context of intense competitiveness as Turkish contractors do not only undertake projects in the domestic market but also in foreign markets including the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa, Middle East, Europe, Asia, etc. They also often face intense competition from local and foreign companies such as U. S., Chinese, Japanese, French, Spanish, German, U. K., and Korean contractors. Given the intense competition, effective marketing of their services is imperative for Turkish contractors in achieving competitive advantage. This study explores the marketing management functions of Turkish construction companies and the extent to which they carry out traditional marketing practices via a questionnaire survey of 71 Turkish contractors. The survey results revealed that Turkish contractors made use of marketing management functions to some extent, yet responding contractors did not attach adequate importance to differentiating their products/services from the products/services offered by their competitors. Since achieving client satisfaction by means of product and/or service differentiation is the ultimate goal, Turkish contractors should carry out all of the traditional marketing practices in order to differentiate themselves in the market, and thereby create competitive advantage.","[Polat, Gul] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-80626 Istanbul, Turkey; [Donmez, Umit] Yuksel Construct Co, Ankara, Turkey","Polat, G (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-80626 Istanbul, Turkey.",polatgu@itu.edu.tr; umit_donmez@yahoo.com,"POLAT, GUL/ABB-3256-2020","POLAT, GUL/0000-0003-2431-033X",,,,47,14,14,2,12,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

Thus, this study couples a construction progress simulation with a real-time dynamic analysis of engineering safety. In this study, a real-time online safety analysis approach based on four-dimensional technology during the construction of underground caverns is introduced, and a dynamic visualization management system of safety information in underground caverns during construction is developed using the OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) Tao Framework and C#, with which integrated management of information related to safety, including geological information, construction progress information, monitoring information, and numerical simulation data, is considered.

However, their subjective mental models influence risk perception, exacerbating the decision-making dilemma. This research integrates project KPIs with future risk perception to develop a mathematical model for facilitating such decision making. Results suggest timely completion, project cost, stakeholder satisfaction, quality and safety as top KPIs, and the influence of managerial pressure as a significant decision contributor.

This study establishes quantitative approaches for estimating the competitive position of contractors between different periods and in different sectors. The location quotient is adopted to evaluate the agglomeration level of contractors in different construction industries. The diversified changes of contractor clusters in nine different industries from 13 countries collected from the ENR are analyzed to highlight the differences in their agglomeration levels from 2009 to 2013. A competitive position matrix model is presented for international contractors in the global market as the location quotient and competitive position matrix, as novel assessment methods are effective in quantitatively analyzing the difference in agglomeration levels between typical contractor groups and the competitive statements of international contractors.

The process of evaluating contractors' applications for bonding is complicated and time-consuming. Surety underwriters are faced with the challenge of considering tens of objective and subjective criteria to make the bonding recommendation. These criteria include a contractor's financial strength, past performance, and other related aspects. Literature review revealed that there is little guidance to surety underwriters in this regard. As a result, the purpose of this paper is to equip surety underwriters with a decision making model for evaluating contractors' applications for bonding. The proposed model is based on data envelopment analysis (DEA). The DEA is a robust nonparametric linear programming approach that is widely used for benchmarking, performance measurement, and decision making. The proposed DEA model guides surety underwriters throughout the decision making process. The model offers surety underwriters the flexibility to accommodate any number of variables in the evaluation process. The proposed model is deployed based on a database that includes 49 contractors. The validity and applicability of the proposed model are scored positively by industry practitioners in terms of methodology used, evaluation criteria, ease of use, performance results, and overall usefulness compared to existing methods.

Successful construction partnering is perceived to derive benefits to both developers and contractors. In view of significant implications to successful project delivery, there has been a surge of research and studies on construction partnering. These studies typically focus on the partnering process as well as the identification of critical success factors. Among the various success factors that underpin partnering success, establishing trust among partners is considered the most important. Moreover, skeptics have been swift to point out that establishing trust in construction is daunting. A better understanding of the role of trust and its manifestation in partnering efforts is therefore of both academic and practical value. In this study, motivating trust in construction partnering is described within the classic framework of the prisoner's dilemma, which suggests the trust cycle can be kick-started if construction partners put cooperation before competition and self-interest. This paper reports a study that is designed to suggest a suitable candidate for the trust initiator. As such, the critical trust factors for two groups of construction partners in Hong Kong-developers/consultants and contractors-are first identified. It is found that performance and permeability of partners are the two most critical trust factors. Performance describes the partner's competence and problem-solving ability as perceived by their counterpart. Permeability reflects the partner's openness in sharing information. The result of a multiple-regression analysis further suggests that the contractor is in a position to initiate trust through competent performance and maintaining effective communication with the client. In this manner, the trust cycle can expand with reciprocal trustworthiness from the client.","City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Bldg & Construct, Construct Dispute Resolut Res Unit, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Davis Langdon & Seah Ltd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Wong, PSP (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Bldg & Construct, Construct Dispute Resolut Res Unit, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,"Cheung, Sai On/B-1954-2009; Wong, Peter S.P./H-5619-2018","Wong, Peter S.P./0000-0002-8429-2551; Cheung, Sai On/0000-0002-8470-5192",,,,46,52,53,0,24,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Therefore, it is crucial to identify key project cost and schedule performance factors. However, despite the attempts of numerous researchers, their results have been inconsistent. Most of the literature has focused solely on the construction phase budget and time overruns; the engineering/design and procurement phase costs and schedule performances have been rarely studied. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach The objective of this study was primarily to identify and prioritize engineering, procurement and construction key performance factors (KPFs) and to strategize ways to prevent performance delays and cost overruns. To achieve these objectives, more than 200 peer-reviewed journal papers, conference proceedings and other scholarly publications were studied and categorized based on industry type, physical location, data collection and analysis methods. Findings It was concluded that both the time required to complete engineering/construction phases and the cost of completing them can be significantly affected by design changes. The two main causes of delays and cost overruns in the procurement phase are construction material shortages and price fluctuations. Other factors affecting all phases of the project are poor economic condition, equipment and labor shortages, delays in owners' timely decision making, poor communication between stakeholders, poor site management and supervision, clients' financial issues and severe weather conditions. A list of phase-based strategies which address the issue of time/cost overruns is presented herein. Originality/value The findings of this study address the potential confusion of the industry's practitioners related to the inconsistent list of potential KPFs and their preventive measurements, and pave the way for the construction research community to conduct future performance-related studies.","[Habibi, Mohammadreza; Kermanshachi, Sharareh] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA","Kermanshachi, S (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",mohammadreza.habibi@mavs.uta.edu; sharareh.kermanshachi@uta.edu,"Habibi, Mohammadreza/M-3605-2019","Habibi, Mohammadreza/0000-0001-6511-0727; Kermanshachi, Sharareh/0000-0003-1952-2557",,,,90,15,15,4,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

This study adopted the descriptive and quantitative design by using a questionnaire to investigate collect data. Seventy-two respondents from the second-grade contracting companies in Jordan participated in the study. The results showed that the conformance of the practices of these companies with the principles of lean construction was less than 65%. Also, the study showed that amongst the principles of lean, customer focus was the most applied in these companies, and showed that these companies lack the culture of providing training and empowerment to their employees and the culture of continuous improvement. This study will help to expand the knowledge about the lean construction application in Jordan, and to investigate the level of the application of this philosophy in different types of projects and different sizes of companies.

The model uses historical continuously free cash flow to firm of construction contractors to simulate possible future cash flow paths. The credit quality scores of construction contractors are then assessed using the CFB credit model.

Furthermore, a process has been developed insuring that the output produced conforms to customer satisfaction without violating any environmental, health, and safety rules and regulations. An effective QES program not only assures a quality product but also reduces costs, and enhances productivity. It is a top down process, i.e., top management together with line management and other employees develop the program and motivate all personnel to accept the process. Important functions to take under consideration are (1) explain and clarify the quality, environmental, and safety performance expected; (2) involve employees in decision-making and problem solving; (3) describe the consequences of poor quality and unsafe/unhealthy work conditions; (4) establish QES goals and provide feedback on performance; (5) provide a self-monitoring system; and (6) recognize and reinforce good performance and develop a reward system.

This study focuses on the ways that stakeholders pursue influence on projects through their expectation of project value. The goal is to identify the value-oriented reasons for stakeholders to utilize specific influence strategies. A multiple case study was implemented in three transport infrastructure projects. The study argues that stakeholders' expectations of project value creation explain the stakeholder influence strategies utilized. The findings link project value with stakeholder influence strategies and reveal four influence strategies in transport infrastructure projects, differentiated according to their different value priorities. The unique value-influence combinations of public infrastructure projects are revealed and discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA.

This study provides a similar investigation for a specific context of project management within a developing country setting. It aims at identifying stakeholders' perspectives on project risks in Indonesia and comparing them against assumptions of rational, normative theories and past findings from general management in developed countries. Two separate cross-sectional surveys were carried out with respondents composed of project contractors (n = 96, response rate = 38.4%) and clients (n = 99, rate = 69.7%), respectively. Empirical results identify significant gaps of risk-related concepts between project stakeholders' perspectives and the rational assumptions of the normative decision theories. For instance, risk is widely viewed by practitioners from the negative domain while the rational theory would suggest a more neutral perspective of risk. The pattern of findings is similar to those from previous empirical studies of developed countries within a general management context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

To control for the myriad of potential problems with self-reports of worker safety performance, we match secondary data provided by the state of Oregon with managers' self-reported responses to operational practices. The results show that the relationship between operational practices and safety outcomes is nuanced with just-in-time harming worker safety, an impact that can be mitigated by the adoption of team-based work up to a point, as the relationship between JIT and team-based work is U-shaped.","[Pagell, Mark] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland; [Dibrell, Clay] Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA; [Veltri, Anthony; Maxwell, Elisabeth] Oregon State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth & Human Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Pagell, M (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland.",mark.pagell@ucd.ie; cdibrell@bus.olemiss.edu; Anthony.veltri@oregonstate.edu; maxwelle@onid.orst.edu,"Dibrell, Clay/E-8115-2017; Helleno, Andre Luis/B-4439-2013","Dibrell, Clay/0000-0003-4407-7168; Helleno, Andre Luis/0000-0001-6054-5895",,,,67,13,13,0,32,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

To lower the propensity of the falls, researchers and safety experts have recommended to supplement the traditional passive fall safety measures with some active measures (such as early identification of task/environmental hazards and personal risk factors). Unfortunately, at present, there is no readily available onsite tool which could identify workers with poor postural controls. This study aimed to develop a static balance monitoring tool for proactive tracking of construction workers on-site using a wearable inertial measurement unit (WIMU) and a smartphone. To this end, a three-phase project was conducted. Firstly, a validation study was conducted to examine the validity of using WIMUs to detect task/fatigue-induced changes in static balance during a 20-second static balance test. The results of the study revealed that WIMUs could detect the post-task subtle changes in static balance with reference to the findings of a force-plate (considered as industrial standard). Secondly, since there were no existing static balance classification methods, five experts were engaged to establish balance classification thresholds using the fuzzy set theory. Thirdly, a mobile phone application was developed for the managers/foremen for onsite balance monitoring of the construction workers using the 20-second test at different times of the day and establishing their corresponding balance performance profiles. This would assist early identification of fall prone workers, plan mitigation schemes before a fall accident happens and ultimately help reduce falls in the construction industry.","[Umer, Waleed; Li, Heng; Lu, Wei] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Szeto, Grace Pui Yuk] Tung Wah Coll, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, 31 Wylie Rd, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Won, Arnold Y.

This paper has the purpose to report a review on project governance literature to draw attention to the context within which the stakeholders are positioned, to extract their roles and relationships inside and outside of the organization and to develop new avenues for research regarding stakeholders in project governance. The conducted thematic analysis reveals that there are three contexts influencing organization's approaches towards stakeholders: success, megaprojects and ethics. The developed conceptual framework illustrates that organizations are in direct contact with external stakeholders at the organizational level and project level. Strategic decisions made at the organizational level are operationalised at the portfolio level and influence the approach towards external stakeholders at the project level. Considering the lack of theories to support general doctrine of stakeholder theory, this research suggests that future governance researchers adopt a broader view in selection of theoretical lenses in order to include the social and psychological aspects of the management of external stakeholders.

To address this, firstly theoretical concepts and previous research on CE were explored, followed by 19 interviews with top managers of contractors in Indonesia. The data was analysed using thematic analysis to identify the key factors for successful CE in Indonesian contracting business. 21key factors of CE have been identified, which are discussed under five categories: autonomy, competitive aggressiveness, innovativeness, proactiveness and risk taking.

Design/methodology/approach The model contains a cost objective function, generalized precedence relationship constraints, activity duration and start time constraints, lag/lead time constraints, execution mode (EM) constraints, project duration constraints, working time unit assignment constraints and resource constraints. The mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) superstructure of discrete solutions covers time-cost-resource options related to various EMs for project activities as well as variants for production process implementation. Findings The proposed model provides the exact optimal output data for project management, such as network diagrams, Gantt charts, histograms and S-curves. In contrast to classic scheduling approaches, here the optimal project structure is obtained as a model-endogenous decision. The project planner is thus enabled to achieve optimization of the production process simultaneously with resource-constrained scheduling of activities in discrete time units and at a minimum total cost. Originality/value The unique value this paper contributes to the body of knowledge reflects through the proposed MINLP model, which is capable of performing the exact cost optimization of production process (where presence and number of activities including their mutual relations are dealt as feasible alternatives, meaning not as fixed parameters) simultaneously with the associated resource-constrained project scheduling, whereby that is achieved within a uniform procedure.","[Cajzek, Rok] GIC GRADNJE Doo, Rogashka Slatina, Slovenia; [Klansek, Uros] Univ Maribor, Fac Civil Engn Transportat Engn & Architecture, Construct Management, Maribor, Slovenia","Klansek, U (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Civil Engn Transportat Engn & Architecture, Construct Management, Maribor, Slovenia.",rok.cajzek@gic-gradnje.si; uros.klansek@um.si,,"Klansek, Uros/0000-0002-7341-8761",Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P2-0129],The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Slovenian Research Agency (Research Core Funding No. P2-0129).,,28,9,9,1,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Networks were analyzed using three methods: manual critical path method scheduling calculations, Primavera Project Management software (P5), and mathematical models using the Optimization Programming Language software. Fuzzy mathematical models that allow the multiobjective optimization of project schedules considering constraints such as time, cost, and unexpected materials shortages were used to verify commonly used methodologies for finding the minimum completion time for projects. The research also used a heuristic procedure for material allocation and sensitivity analysis to test five cases of material shortage, which increase the cost of construction and delay the completion time of projects. From the results obtained during the research investigation, it was determined that it is not just whether there is a shortage of a material but rather the way materials are allocated to different activities that affect project durations. It is important to give higher priority to activities that have minimum float values, instead of merely allocating materials to activities that are immediately ready to start.","[Castro-Lacouture, Daniel] Georgia Inst Technol, Bldg Construct Program, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Suer, Gursel A.] Ohio Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Gonzalez-Joaqui, Julian] Bros Concrete Construct Inc, Vienna, VA USA; [Yates, J.

The Building Control Surveyor reviews designs and on-site construction in order to evaluate, and ultimately certify, compliance with the regulations, but little research has been carried out to investigate the role of these professionals in promoting sustainable construction. A qualitative study was conducted, comprising semi-structured interviews with 21 building control surveyors and 4 key informants from professional bodies in England. The building surveyors initially positioned their power as wholly derived from the regulations, thus constraining their contribution on sustainability to regulation enforcement. However, this stood in contradiction to their recognition of being valued and influential members of the project team. Descriptions of day-to-day activities included sharing common goals with the team, providing guidance based on their knowledge and experience, and developing collaborative relationships. Based on theories of power, these practices may be seen as processes of power. The primary conclusion is that building control surveyors are indeed powerful in the project team, and, with greater recognition of the varied forms of power available to them above and beyond regulatory certification, they could extend their influence in daily working interactions to promote more sustainable construction.","[Murtagh, Niamh; Achkar, Loulwa; Roberts, Aeli] UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, London, England","Murtagh, N (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, London, England.",n.murtagh@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,49,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Owing to vast uncertainties and complexities, international construction entry decisions are intricate. Although conventional Probability-Impact (P-I) risk models are useful, the firm's capabilities are missing in early assessments for project selection decision. Hence, this study aims to develop a capability-based risk assessment (CapRA) calculator for international contractors venturing overseas. The international construction firm's capabilities are explored using resource-based views, dynamic capabilities, and Porter's generic value chain theories to conceptualize an integrated framework for risk assessment. Additionally, a questionnaire was sent to international construction firms operating outside their home countries to appraise their firm's capabilities and international construction project risk significance values. Then, a partial least squares approach was used to analyze the data. The findings are used to develop a novel CapRA model, which is then formulated into modified P-I risk model equations and computerized into a CapRA calculator to simplify the application. In essence, this study contributes to both knowledge and practice by developing and testing a model to improve the accuracy and facilitate project selection decisions for international construction firms.","[Wang, Chen] Huaqiao Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Fujian Prov Higher Educ Engn Res Ctr, Intelligence & Automat Construct, Xiamen 361021, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Loo, Siaw Chuing] Univ Malaya, Fac Built Environm, Ctr Bldg Construct & Trop Architecture, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Yap, Jeffrey Boon Hui] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Surveying, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Abdul-Rahman, Hamzah] Vis Coll, Fac Sci, Petaling Jaya 47301, Selangor, Malaysia","Yap, JBH (corresponding author), Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Surveying, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.",derekisleon@gmail.com; siawchuing@um.edu.my; bhyap@utar.edu.my; hamzahraha@gmail.com,"Loo, Siaw-Chuing/AAT-3921-2020; Wang, Chen/F-1586-2010","Loo, Siaw-Chuing/0000-0003-2528-1817; Wang, Chen/0000-0001-7892-3575; Yap, Jeffrey Boon Hui/0000-0003-4332-0031","University of Malaya, MalaysiaUniversiti Malaya [BK002-2017]","The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge University of Malaya, Malaysia (BK002-2017) for providing the financial support for this research.

On-site construction refers to the energy consumed during the installation of materials up to project practical completion and represents the largest share of construction process CO2 emissions. Contractors have a pivotal role to play in reducing CO2 and energy consumption due to their significant involvement in project procurement and on-site construction. The key challenges and opportunities are investigated for delivering on-site energy management within UK non-domestic projects from a contractor's perspective. A case study is presented of a large UK principal contractor's on-site energy management practices, based on a wide geographical sample of non-domestic projects and operatives. Shortcomings are found within the contractor's current on-site energy management procedure across the three reporting levels (director, operations and project). Findings identified the lack of data authentication as a significant challenge, whereas capturing additional project variables to facilitate future benchmarking was deemed as a key opportunity for on-site energy management enhancement.","[Davies, Philip J.; Emmitt, Stephen; Firth, Steven K.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Bldg Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England","Davies, PJ (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Bldg Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",p.davies@lboro.ac.uk; s.emmitt@lboro.ac.uk; s.k.firth@lboro.ac.uk,,"Emmitt, Stephen/0000-0002-8277-3378",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/G037272/1],The authors wish to acknowledge the research funding (Grant Reference: EP/G037272/1) and support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and all individuals who contributed to the research findings.

Using a sample of 113 capital projects, we applied partial least squares structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. The results confirm that the three antecedents indirectly influence project performance through teamworking quality. There is no empirical evidence that these antecedents directly influence project performance: relational attitudes, teams' joint capability, and collaboration practices do not automatically lead to a successful collaboration without day-to-day managerial intervention in teamworking processes. We also found that the parties' expectations regarding continuing relationships, as a consequence of good project performance, are directly affected by relational attitudes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve this objective, a structured questionnaire survey comprising 43 factors that were shortlisted based on relevant previous investigations on bidding practices in the construction industry, and the input of local industry experts and professionals, was distributed to a statistically representative sample of contractors. Using the Relative Importance Index technique, the following critical factors are identified: (1) previous experience with the employer, (2) need for work, (3) current workload, (4) previous experience in similar projects, (5) size of project, (6) identity and reputation of the employer in the industry, (7) financial stability of the employer, (8) availability of other projects, (9) promptness of the employer in the payment process, and (10) tender documents quality level. The outcomes reported in this study can be used to provide employers, consultants, contractors, and policymakers, guidance for focusing, acting upon, and controlling the cardinal factors perceived to impact contractors' bidding behaviors in an environment on the brink of undergoing an unprecedented boom in demand for faster delivery and lower cost of constructed facilities.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that affect the decision of indigenous construction contractors to bid or not to bid in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach - Analysis was conducted on data from questionnaires received from 64 engineering management employees of leading construction companies which are members of Nigeria's Federation of Construction Industry. The study identified 41 significant decision factors often considered by Nigerian indigenous contractors before the bid. Mean item scores were obtained for each of the factors. Principal component analysis was used to point out the most significant decision factors. Findings - Results revealed significant orthogonal relationships between the factors. Only 11 of the 41 factors are statistically significant to influence contractors' decision to bid or not to bid. Most of the significant items were amongst the least rated items by the participants. The post hoc decision factors include consultant's interpretation of project specifications, previous relationship between the intending bidder and client, availability of other projects at the time of bidding, technological complexity of the project under consideration and prequalification requirements. Others include the propensity for resource price fluctuation, business capacity of partners, amount of own work vs subcontracted work, required rate of return on investment and difficulty in obtaining finance. Originality/value - The practical implication of these findings are as follows: the orthogonal relationship between the decision factors implies non-linear relationship between the factors and actual decision to bid or not to bid, and that bid success is often not predictable by bid behaviour; many of the bid decision factors rated highest by indigenous contractors seldom impact the contractors' actual bid decisions; local and international players can adopt the significant decision factors elicited in this study for managing their structures for inter-organizational partnerships.","[Olatunji, Oluwole Alfred] Curtin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Perth, WA, Australia; [Aje, Olaniyi Isaac] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Quant Surveying, Akure, Nigeria; [Makanjuola, Sina] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Bldg, Akure, Nigeria","Olatunji, OA (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Perth, WA, Australia.",oluwole.olatunji@curtin.edu.au,,"Makanjuola, Sina/0000-0001-6885-7287",,,,54,14,14,1,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

In addition, international construction project risks are highly interdependent. The objectives of this study are to (1) explore the risk paths in the international construction projects performed by Chinese contractors, and (2) examine the risk effects on the objectives of these projects. To achieve the research objectives, a total of 60 risks were identified from literature review and a questionnaire survey was conducted with 104 professionals from Chinese international contractors. Adopting the structural equation modeling technique, this study proposed a networking of 20 significant risk paths. Specifically, host government-related risk, contractor's lack of experience, and contractors' lack of managerial skills had significant effect on project cost, quality, and schedule objectives, respectively. Moreover, host government-related risk affected project cost performance indirectly through resource price fluctuation, and contractors' lack of managerial skills affects project schedule objective indirectly through decrease in productivity. This study contributes to the literature because it is different from most of the previous studies, which depended on separate risk categories and generic checklists but failed to explore the potential interrelationships among risks in international construction projects. Additionally, the identification of risk path scenarios enables practitioners to gain a better understanding of the sources and impact areas of risks, and to better deal with the risks, thereby contributing to the practice.

The finding shows that there is a lack of standardization in the practice of risk management. Risk management has been mandated by the company and that the application has improved project performance.

They facilitate useful explanations for better understanding of research findings. However, the use of theories to advance studies in sustainable construction has been given little attention. According to Agenda 21 for sustainable construction in developing countries, contractors are yet to achieve capability to establish sustainable construction due to knowledge gaps and lack of relevant frameworks. The enormity of the ramifications of contractors' inability to adapt to environmentally sustainable construction (ESC) justifies adopting a multi-theory approach for understanding the dynamics of adaptation to ESC. In this study, the usefulness of three theories in facilitating understanding of the complexities surrounding contractors' adaptation to ESC was reviewed. The three theories are: resilience theory, ecological modernization theory and institutional theory. Following the review, it was found that resilience, isomorphic drivers and technology are integral elements needed for improving contractors' capability to adapt to ESC. The theoretical review yielded integrated framework that conceptualizes the dynamics and actions relevant to contractor's adaptation to ESC.","[Mensah, Sarfo] Kumasi Tech Univ, Dept Bldg Technol, Kumasi, Ghana; [Ayarkwa, Joshua; Nani, Gabriel] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci Technol, Dept Bldg Technol, Kumasi, Ghana","Mensah, S (corresponding author), Kumasi Tech Univ, Dept Bldg Technol, Kumasi, Ghana.",sarfmenghana@gmail.com,"Mensah, Sarfo/AAR-8797-2021",,,,,61,4,4,1,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

However, the influence of these strategies on contractors' performance has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this paper is to identify strategies of the international Malaysian contractors and determine the influence of these strategies on their performance during different periods of economic fluctuations. The data of this study was collected from the records of 452 overseas construction projects completed between 1993 and 2016, which covered five periods of booms and recessions. Based on the regression analysis, the results showed that localization influences contractors' performance during boom periods. Joint venture with home-country contractors may have a positive impact during both boom and recession periods. Product diversification has a positive influence during one recession period.

Aim of this study was to investigate the potential for construction contractor organisations to enhance the value addition to the client while improving efficiency through VCM principles. Mixed research approach was used. Data was collected using a questionnaire survey and expert interviews. Altogether, 50 (Value-adding activities) VAAs relevant for Sri Lankan construction organisations were identified, which were categorised under four groups of primary VAAs and six groups of secondary VAAs. The VAAs were further mapped into Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) Matrix based on their cost and the value addition resulting in 12 VAAs in quadrant I (concentrate here), 18 VAAs in quadrant II (keep up the good work) 12 VAAs in quadrant III (low priority), and 8 VAAs in quadrant IV (possible overkill). Reasons for lack of VC Analysis (VCA) were also identified and suggestions for improvement proposed.

Mainstream research has provided various advanced digital solutions to solve these problems; however, they have not addressed how to make reliable decisions with digital models to manage the demand fluctuations of construction materials. This study proposes a transshipment approach to enable the lateral sharing of perishable materials and optimize material allocation for a contractor's project portfolio. The transshipment approach includes two main steps. First, the daily material supply and demand data are collected from a continuously updated schedule and three-dimensional models as input for calculating unused material quantities. Second, an evolutionary optimization algorithm is used for optimizing the transshipment quantities with minimal cost. As proof of concept, the proposed transshipment approach is demonstrated by looking at a portfolio of seven building projects managed by the same contractor. The demonstration shows that the allocation of the unused materials helps to avoid waste and reduce costs from over-ordered materials by around 52%. As a result, this also leads to improved coordination between contractors and suppliers and better material flow in construction projects.","[Chen, Qian; Adey, Bryan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Construct & Infrastruct Management, Zurich, Switzerland; [de Soto, Borja Garcia] New York Univ Abu Dhabi NYUAD, Div Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [de Soto, Borja Garcia] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Brooklyn, NY USA","Chen, Q (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Construct & Infrastruct Management, Zurich, Switzerland.",chen@ibi.baug.ethz.ch,,"CHEN, QIAN/0000-0002-5899-9342; Adey, Bryan Tyrone/0000-0002-4932-5901",,,,54,1,1,1,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

If both of them are instituted into law, governance alignment should emerge in the long run. However, in Taiwan government-pay P3 systems are not a lawful route, forcing the government to employ user-pay P3 systems regardless of project types. This gives researchers an unusual opportunity to examine what would happen as a result of an inappropriate choice of P3 models.

Nevertheless, disaster recovery remains understudied within the context of emergency management. Various models have been developed to address disaster recovery. However, those models neither considered the stakeholders' needs and preferences, nor the vulnerability of the host community. This paper presents a decision-making framework for disaster recovery that uses a bottom-up approach to capture the needs of the impacted residents and decreases the social vulnerability of host communities. The authors developed the following research methodology: (1) use a well-established community specific social vulnerability assessment tool to evaluate the society vulnerability; (2) model the multisector stakeholders through a root-to-grass technique that captures their objectives, strategies, and learning behaviors; (3) simulate the recovery progress of the impacted community using an agent-based simulation toolkit; and (4) interpret the results to provide the decision makers with optimal recovery strategies. The restorations efforts in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in three coastal counties in Mississippi were used as the problem domain. Accordingly, the proposed model was implemented on a multiagent-based simulation toolkit with geographic information system (GIS) abilities. This research optimized the budget for the State Disaster Recovery Coordinator and the residents' insurance plans choices. As such, this study provided better social vulnerability indices than the existing conditions currently found in the areas under investigation.

It is further complicated to prevent collisions and reduce idle transportation time among multiple overlapping tower cranes. Unlike previous research attempts, this study aims to provide an optimal solution to this multiple crane service scheduling problem (MCSSP). Firstly, the MCSSP was translated to a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. Then, the model was optimized by 1) distributing the lifting requests in overlapping areas to the proper tower cranes; 2) selecting the appropriate supply location to serve each lifting request; and 3) arranging the lifting sequences of each tower crane to complete the requests. Compared with previous methods, the proposed MILP model (solved using GurobiTM) can result in the saving of 6.54%-18.07% of total operation costs meanwhile achieving the non-collision goal. The findings of this research can be deployed in optimizing efficiency and safety in the real-life scheduling of multiple overlapping tower cranes.","[Huang, Chun; Li, Wenjie; Liu, Meng; Liu, Zhansheng] Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Architecture & Civil Engn, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Huang, Chun; Li, Wenjie; Liu, Meng; Liu, Zhansheng] Beijing Univ Technol, Key Lab Urban Secur & Disaster Engn, Minist Educ, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Lu, Weisheng; Xue, Fan] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Architecture, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Liu, ZS (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Architecture & Civil Engn, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China.",lzs4216@163.com,,,Science & Technology Fund of Beijing Education Committee [KM202110005019],This work was supported by the Science & Technology Fund of Beijing Education Committee (No: KM202110005019) .,,61,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Many different issues affect asphalt binder quality. Such problems can significantly increase the pavement life-cycle cost, which means that a pay adjustment (PA) is needed. Unfortunately, the quantitative analysis of this issue is very complex. The objectives of this study were to model the dependence of the pavement life-cycle cost on asphalt binder quality and to determine the quantitative relationship between bitumen viscosity and the PA for a given class of boundary conditions. In addition to modeling this problem theoretically, experiments and simulations were carried out through the use of the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide. We then derived the consequences of these effects on life-cycle cost by using a specific life-cycle cost model. Our results demonstrate that asphalt binder viscosity can strongly affect the expected pavement life and the PA, and thus needs to be taken into account in contract and construction management.","[Pratico, F.

Quality is acknowledged to be an important component of project management, but its joint relationship with time and cost previously has not been modeled. This paper introduces the notion of a quality function for individual tasks and uses the functional form of the bivariate normal (after also evaluating a bivariate logistic form), to model quality at the task level. Using real data from two case studies, a translation agency and a software development company, the quality function is specified and incorporated into a mathematical programming model that allows quality to be explicitly considered in project planning and scheduling. An alternative model formulation leads to the creation of quality level curves that enable managers to evaluate the nonlinear tradeoffs between quality, time, and cost for each of the example projects. The results of these analyses lead to specific decisions about the planned values for these three fundamental dimensions at the task level and provide insights for project planning and scheduling that can be gained through improved understanding of the choices and tradeoffs.","[Liberatore, Matthew J.] Villanova Univ, Dept Management & Operat, Villanova, PA 19087 USA; [Pollack-Johnson, Bruce] Villanova Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Villanova, PA 19087 USA","Liberatore, MJ (corresponding author), Villanova Univ, Dept Management & Operat, Villanova, PA 19087 USA.",matthew.liberatore@villanova.edu; bruce.pollack-johnson@villanova.edu,,,,,,19,24,25,1,114,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

In this work, we present an approach for energy-aware flow shop scheduling problem and energy-aware job shop scheduling problem considering the process speed as the main energy-related decision variable. This approach allows one to set the appropriate process speed for every considered operation in the corresponding machine. When the speed is high, the processing time is short but the energy demand increases, and vice versa. Therefore, two objectives are worked together: a production objective, paired with an energy efficiency objective. A generic elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm was implemented to solve both problems. Results from a simple comparative design of experiments and a nonparametric test show that it is possible to smooth the energy demand profile and obtain reductions that average 19.8% in energy consumption. This helps to reduce peak loads and drops on applied energy sources demand, stabilizing the conversion units operational efficiency across the entire operational time with a minimum effect on the production maximum completion time (makespan).","[Vallejos-Cifuentes, Pablo] Univ Nacl Colombia, Calle 59 63-20, Medellin 050034, Colombia; [Ramirez-Gomez, Camilo] Royal Inst Technol KTH, Stockholm, Sweden; [Escudero-Atehortua, Ana] Univ Pontificia Bolivariana, Mech Engn, Medellin, Colombia; [Rodriguez Velasquez, Elkin] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Engn Management, Bogota, Colombia","Vallejos-Cifuentes, P (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Calle 59 63-20, Medellin 050034, Colombia.",pevallejosc@unal.edu.co,,"Ramirez Gomez, Camilo/0000-0002-7217-3838; Escudero-Atehortua, Ana/0000-0003-2962-4426","ColcienciasDepartamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias [1101-543-32101]",The authors acknowledges Colciencias for supporting this research project with code [1101-543-32101].,,56,1,1,2,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1042-9247,2377-0643,,ENG MANAG J,EMJ-Eng.

For this purpose, qualitative interviews were conducted with experts from Malaysian international contractor companies. The findings highlight the reasons why HJV is not common and the factors that facilitate HJV application among contractors. Factors facilitate the application of HJV include develop strategy for partnering, plan for HJV and risk, select the right partner and others. These factors are categorized into three main project management processes, which are HJV planning, HJV execution and HJV monitoring and control.

For a project manager such as a general contractor who subcontracts most tasks of a project, or other project managers who face decisions concerning the level of quality to perform for each task, this is not a realistic assumption. In this paper, we extend the standard discrete time/cost tradeoff problem by assuming that each option for each task is evaluated for its duration, cost, and also its quality. We then provide a mixed integer linear programming model for solving one version of this problem, and illustrate with an example. W next formulate a goal programming mixed integer linear program for a very general version of the problem. This formulation allows for many different definitions of quality, and many combinations of time, cost, and quality goals with preemptive and/or weighted priorities, and is also illustrated with an example. We show how these models can be used to generate quality level curves to illustrate the tradeoffs among time, cost, and quality. These level curves can then be used by project managers to make project scheduling decisions that explicitly model and consider quality as well as time and cost, so that better and more appropriate decisions can be made for a particular situation.","Villanova Univ, Villanova, PA 19085 USA","Pollack-Johnson, B (corresponding author), Villanova Univ, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",Matthew.Liberatore@villanova.edu,,,,,,31,55,60,1,20,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855 USA",0018-9391,,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

In other industries many previous studies employ support vector machine (SVM) or other Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methods for corporate default prediction using the sample-matching method, which produces sample selection biases. In order to avoid the sample selection biases, this paper used all available firm-years samples during the sample period. Yet this brings a new challenge: the number of non-defaulted samples greatly exceeds the defaulted samples, which is referred to as between-class imbalance. Although the SVM algorithm is a powerful learning process, it cannot always be applied to data with extreme distribution characteristics. This paper proposes an enforced support vector machine-based model (ESVM model) for the default prediction in the construction industry, using all available firm-years data in our sample period to solve the between-class imbalance. The traditional logistic regression model is provided as a benchmark to evaluate the forecasting ability of the ESVM model. All financial variables related to the prediction of contractor default risk as well as 7 variables selected by the Multivariate Discriminant Analysis (MDA) stepwise method are put in the models for comparison. The empirical results of this paper show that the ESVM model always outperforms the logistic regression model, and is more convenient to use because it is relatively independent of the selection of variables. Thus, we recommend the proposed ESVM model as an alternative to the traditionally used logistic model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Tsai, L.

Little is known how the decision of adopting construction robots or not is made in organizations, which inhibits the benefits of robots from being fully realized. This paper aims to investigate the determinants affecting construction robot adoption for building works at the organizational level. Drawing on the technology-organization-environment framework, a research model with 11 hypotheses on determinants was developed and empirically evaluated via a survey of 94 typical building contractors in Hong Kong using a partial least-squares structural equation modeling technique. The results indicate that relative advantage, top management support, organizational readiness, market competitive pressure, and high costs are significantly related to the adoption, among which top management support is most influential. A two-stage conceptual framework is derived that provides theoretical insights on the determinants and reveals the complexities and influence dynamics of determinants on the adoption during technology development. The findings offer useful suggestions for the effective development of robots for building works and lay a foundation for construction innovation adoption in a wider context.","[Pan, Mi; Pan, Wei] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Pan, M (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",panmi@connect.hku.hk; wpan@hku.hk,"Pan, Wei/F-9783-2012; Pan, Mi/AAX-6112-2020","Pan, Wei/0000-0002-2720-3073; Pan, Mi/0000-0002-5134-8205",,,,55,2,2,13,31,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Owners typically screen contractors by using the following key criteria: financial stability, technical ability, management capability, health and safety, and reputation. This study focuses primarily on the construction contractor's financial stability during the prequalification phase and employs a dynamic threshold cash flow based structural model (DCFM) to assess the credit quality score for each construction contractor. This model differs from the existing credit model because it only requires accounting statement information; thus, it is applicable to both publicly listed and private construction contractors. Moreover, only a small portion of companies are rated in the construction industry; this model is especially useful for owners to assess the credit quality of unrated construction companies. The Standard & Poor's issuer credit rating is used as the benchmark to evaluate the model's discrimination ability to differentiate financially qualified contractors from unqualified contractors. Additionally, the validation indicator area under curve (AUC) is utilized to demonstrate whether the DCFM can identify different credit grade firms according to the model's credit quality scores. The AUC results of the first three years of this model are 0.861, 0.833, and 0.819, indicating that this model achieves excellent discriminatory ability and is useful for assessing the credit risk of construction contractors.

Such a relationship is investigated based on three key components: six antecedents of trust as independent variables (reputation, competence, integrity, communication, reciprocity, and contract), two types of trust as mediating variables (calculative and relative trust), and project success as a dependent variable. The results differentiate and compare the perceptions of trust for both owners and contractors in terms of their priority for antecedents of trust, the influential mechanism that connects trust with project success, and the numerical relationship between calculative trust and relational trust. For both parties, relational trust generates a higher impact on project success than calculative trust, but contractors perceived the relationship between relational trust and calculative trust as being linear while owners believed such a relationship is a quadratic function. This research provides new evidence to support the development of trust theory in the construction industry, and it can also help construction practitioners and policymakers to better understand the development and management of trust in the construction industry.","[Jiang, Weiping] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yujie] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 125677, Singapore; [Le, Yun] Tongji Univ, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Lu, YJ (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 125677, Singapore.",swingopen@szu.edu.cn; luy@nus.edu.sg; yunle@kcpm.com.cn,"Lu, Yujie/AAF-1872-2020; Lu, Yujie/K-3003-2014","Lu, Yujie/0000-0002-9585-0192",,,,123,42,42,12,133,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

However, it is an arduous task to understand people's beliefs and attitudes that collectively make up traffic safety-related influences. The growing acceptance of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have spurred great interest in massive data collection and its use in conducting a comprehensive analysis of people's viewpoints on a particular topic. This study applied social media mining to shed light on traffic safety culture in the state of Washington. To this end, the researchers collected traffic safety-related tweets over the past 4 years in Washington based on a set of keywords. After cleaning and reprocessing, the collected tweets were used in sentiment analysis using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) to measure the public's beliefs and attitudes toward the importance of traffic safety, possibility of zero fatalities, usefulness of traffic law enforcement, and six types of high-risk behaviors, including impaired driving, speeding, distracted driving, unrestrained vehicle occupants, teenage drivers, and older drivers. Next, the topic modeling technique was applied to discover important latent topics related to traffic safety culture. This research, which capitalizes on social media mining, overcomes the limitations of the conventional survey method, which are time-consuming and costly. The generated information may facilitate understanding of the barriers to preventing fatal traffic accidents in Washington and around the country and developing solutions to overcome them.","[Sujon, Mohhammad; Dai, Fei] West Virginia Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 6103, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Dai, F (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 6103, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",mas0130@mix.wvu.edu; fei.dai@mail.wvu.edu,,,Washington Traffic Safety Commission (WTSC),This research was supported by the Washington Traffic Safety Commission (WTSC).

The purpose of this paper is to develop a unified approach for JVC selection. The proposed approach integrates competitive information and collaborative information, focusing on the hesitant fuzzy variables of the bid evaluators. An optimization model is established based on the maximizing deviation (MD) principle to determine the criterion weights objectively. Then, the weights of the bid evaluators are obtained through calculating the relative closeness coefficients of each bid evaluator and the group from the JVCs to the fuzzy positive-ideal solution (FPIS). All the potential JVCs are ranked through minimizing the deviation model based on the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach. A case study of the JVC selection process for the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge (a large-scale island and tunnel engineering project) was conducted to illustrate the proposed approach. The results showed that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed method can select the contractors with good collaborative performance. This is important for the practice, because collaborative criteria are reflected in the key criteria currently used in JVC evaluation and selection. The findings from this study can help the JVC manager to identify a JVC with good collaborative performance and control the project risk from the initial stage.","[Liang, Ru; Zhang, Jinwen; Sheng, Zhaohan] Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jinwen] Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge Author, 368 Henglong Rd, Xiangzhou Dist 519060, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Changzhi] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiangyu] Curtin Univ, Sch Built Environm, Perth, WA 6102, Australia; [Wang, Xiangyu] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Housing & Interior Design, Seoul 130701, South Korea","Wu, CZ (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",rliang124@163.com; zjw@hzmbo.com; c.wu@curtin.edu.au; zhsheng@nju.edu.cn; Xiangyu.Wang@curtin.edu.au,"Wang, Xiangyu/B-6232-2013","Wu, Changzhi/0000-0002-2276-6862; Wang, Xiangyu/0000-0001-8718-6941","Sino-Australia Collaborative Innovation Alliance for Megaproject Management in the Era of Internet+ and Big Data; National Natural Science Foundation of Key Projects [71390520]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91646123, 71471077, 71671088, 71571098, 71501102, 71271103, 61473326]; program for Outstanding Ph.D. candidate of Nanjing University [201601A001, 201702B041]; Australia Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP170104612]","The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

Selecting the right contractor for the right job can significantly influence the overall project performance. In the selection process, construction clients have to know all financial, technical and general information about the contractors to determine the most appropriate one for the project. Within this context, clients should consider several criteria that may include quality of production, adequacy of technical staff and financial stability. In this study, a survey was carried out among 52 construction professionals working at the Public Housing Development Administration (PHDA) in Turkey. The objective of this survey is to examine the relative weights of the criteria that have been using by this owner in the construction contractor selection process. Afterwards, a web-based contractor evaluation system, WEB-CONTEST, by which the contractors can be evaluated based on a combined criterion, is proposed. The system facilitates the contractor selection process and enables the construction owner to select the most correct contractors for its relevant projects.","Anadolu Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-26555 Eskisehir, Turkey","Arslan, G (corresponding author), Anadolu Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-26555 Eskisehir, Turkey.",gokhana@anadolu.edu.tr,,,,,,63,13,13,1,16,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

This paper presents an approach that allows data-driven and schedule-oriented supply chain coordination in the face of demand fluctuations. The approach consists of two main steps that contractors should take: 1) monitor the demand fluctuations based on a 4D model that captures the as-built status and updated look-ahead schedules, 2) make decisions to modify original orders to accommodate the demand fluctuations where orders are determined by a heuristic evolutionary algorithm. As a proof of concept, the coordination approach is demonstrated using an example project featuring a five-day in-situ construction of concrete walls. Results from this example show that using the approach improves the responsiveness of concrete planning and ordering. As a result, this leads to improved collaboration between suppliers and contractors in construction projects.","[Chen, Qian; Adey, Bryan T.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Construct & Infrastruct Management, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [de Soto, Borja Garcia] New York Univ Abu Dhabi NYUAD, Div Engn, Expt Res Bldg,POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [de Soto, Borja Garcia] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, 6 MetroTech Ctr, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA","Chen, Q (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Construct & Infrastruct Management, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",chen@ibi.baug.ethz.ch; garcia.de.soto@nyu.edu; adey@ibi.baug.ethz.ch,,"Adey, Bryan Tyrone/0000-0002-4932-5901; CHEN, QIAN/0000-0002-5899-9342",,,,53,4,4,4,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Therefore trade-off between project time and cost is necessary. In projects, each activity can be started at different time points, depending on its precedence relationship and resource availability. Also cost and duration of the activities could be changed depending on the allocated resources. In addition, another strategy that affects the project total time and cost is resource leveling, which is applied to reduce excessive fluctuations in the resource usage. In this paper multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP), discrete time-cost trade-off problem (DTCTP) and also resource allocation and resource leveling problem (RLP) are considered simultaneously. This paper presents the multi-mode resource-constrained discrete time-cost-resource optimization (MRC-DTCRO) model in order to select starting the time and the execution mode of each activity satisfying all the project constraints. To solve these problems, non-domination based genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is employed to search for the non-dominated solutions considering total project time, cost, and resources moment deviation as three objectives. The results of MRC-DTCRO model presented in this paper show that adding the resource leveling capability to the previously developed multi-mode resource-constrained discrete time-cost trade-off problem (MRC-DTCTP) models provides more practical solutions in terms of resource allocation and leveling, which makes this research applicable to both construction industry and researchers.

Mobilising Furneaux and Barraket's social procurement typology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior managers from eight tier-one contractors in the Australian construction industry to explore and classify the types of social procurement strategies used in projects, the types of social value created and the barriers to implementation. Documentary data were collected in the form of company policies and contract requirements. Results demonstrate the conceptual merit of Furneaux and Barraket's typology in a construction industry context by highlighting different constraints on social value creation for each type of social procurement. These results also indicate that approaches to social procurement in the Australian construction industry are generally driven by a philosophy of risk mitigation rather than opportunity maximisation, and are confined to low-value and low-risk construction activities and are constrained by a lack of existing and new supply chain social-value creation capacity. Construction industry social value chains are fragile in Australia, and it is concluded that in building the sector's significant untapped capacity to deliver social value to the communities in which it builds, priority should be given to three main strategies: third sector capacity building; barrier-to-entry reduction and skills development in managing new cross-sector collaborations among public, private and third sector organisations.","[Loosemore, M.; Reid, S.] Univ New South Wales, Fac Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Loosemore, M (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Fac Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",m.loosemore@unsw.edu.au,,"Loosemore, Martin/0000-0002-3189-4655",,,,88,6,6,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Proper handling of highway networks plays a significant role in enhancing the functionality of a bridge network. Besides that, estimating bridge construction costs is an increasing necessity at the conceptual design stage for accurate budgeting and effective funding. The degree of subjectivity involved in decision making of bridge projects is the main factor that influences bridge cost estimation and linear scheduling at the conceptual design stage. Objectives of this study are intended to demonstrate the viability of integrating a decision support system comprising qualitative objective functions with a bridge information management system (BrIMS) in order to overcome subjectivity in decision makings. An external data interchange protocol is implemented in synchrony with interoperability standards. The deployment of the proposed system shall include an all-in-one bridge construction cost estimation tool that can provide users with recommendations for bridge design alternatives. An integration of an expert system, cost estimation, and linear scheduling is proposed by automating cost and time scheduling techniques at the conceptual design stage. Successful implementation of such a system is a technological achievement of novelty to the integration of BrIMS solutions with probabilistic fuzzy logic strategic approaches.","[Markiz, Nizar; Jrade, Ahmad] Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Markiz, N (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",nmark086@uottawa.ca,,,,,,18,3,3,1,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

The prevailing safety training techniques involve one-way delivery of slideshow presentations with written handouts that often describe common hazards and generic solutions. Such delivery does not facilitate active learning, development of contextual examples, or emotional engagement necessary for adult learners to gain new knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new multimedia learning simulation-based training program called naturalistic injury simulation (NIS). Naturalistic injury simulation involves demonstrating the cause and effect of hand injuries using a hyperrealistic replica of a human hand within realistic scenarios. Out of 1,200 workers that participated, 489 workers were randomly selected for the quasi-field-based longitudinal experiment. Change in emotional states among the participants due to the simulations was analyzed across various demographical dimensions. Analysis showed that workers experienced a surge in negative emotions. Findings suggest that NIS will lead workers across the different demographical groups to perceive more risk by being more vigilant and detail oriented.

The research reported in this paper was initiated from the idea that existing microscopic traffic simulation models could be complemented with a vehicle dynamics model having an enhanced capability of realizing the vehicle dynamics including pitch, yaw, and roll and generating realistic vehicle trajectories. In addition, a driver aggressiveness model derived from a lane change vehicle trajectories model was incorporated into the lane change vehicles in the microscopic traffic simulation model. The resulting microscopic traffic simulation model vehicle trajectories were processed through the vehicle dynamics model to account for the vehicle dynamics and the traffic conflicts were identified through the surrogate safety assessment model. The integrated microscopic traffic/vehicle dynamics simulation environment resulted in 9.5% fewer traffic conflicts as compared with the microscopic traffic simulation model only approach. The results of the two conflict estimation approaches, from the (1) proposed integrated approach, and (2) microscopic traffic simulation model only approach, were analyzed to estimate their correlation with the actual traffic crashes. These correlations were then used to compare the effectiveness of these approaches in assessing surrogate safety. This analysis from the research reported in this paper showed that the traffic conflicts obtained from the proposed approach exhibited a stronger correlation (i.e., 0.72 correlation coefficient) with traffic crashes than the existing approach did (i.e., 0.61 correlation coefficient). A cross-validation test on the confidence intervals of the correlation coefficients showed that the correlation coefficients have very tight confidence intervals (i.e., 0.02 for both cases) indicating that the newly developed vehicle dynamics model-integrated surrogate safety simulation environment is a superior and valid alternative in assessing the surrogate safety.

However, establishing joint OSH engagement between managers and workers is still a challenge. Little is known about how managers and workers' complaining about OSH affects collective OSH action and the quality of manager-worker relations. Drawing on an understanding of complaining as boundary work, this study empirically analyses how managers and workers' verbalisations either downplay (collaboration) or build (demarcation) boundaries. Interviews and observations between managers and workers were carried out on a construction project in Denmark to identify why and how complaining is used. A typology consisting of four complaining mechanisms was developed, highlighting their associated relational dynamics: (1) Shifting responsibility for advancing OSH, (2) Defending oneself against strained working conditions, (3) Dealing strategically with criticism, and (4) Blaming other occupational groups. Complaining about OSH as boundary work - both collaboration and demarcation - between managers and workers furthers professional fragmentation and conflicts OSH collaboration, yet it occurs in a safe space for professional disagreement. We suggest that these communicational aspects and associated relational dynamics should be an area of increased focus in order to promote managers and workers' OSH collaboration.","[Jeschke, Katharina N.; Dyreborg, Johnny; Kines, Pete; Ajslev, Jeppe Z.

Nevertheless, how safety plans are articulated through the actions of supervisors to the workforce remains unclear. By conceptualizing safety from the window of the psychological contract (PC), this research proposes that if the psychological contract of safety (PCS)-if reciprocal commitments between a supervisor and a worker are fulfilled-then WSB will be positively influenced. Using a PCS scale based on employer obligations, multilevel surveys were performed at five construction sites in Sydney, Australia, and data from 352 workers associated with a mega-construction project were collected. A hypothetical model proposing the PCS as an intervention is presented. The model is validated using structural equation modeling (SEM), the data reliability and validity of the survey findings are ensured, and the goodness of fit of the proposed model was examined. The results indicate that PCS successfully mediates the relationship between two important safety agents-the supervisor and the worker. When addressing the research gap, this article explains how the concept of PCS can be further utilized to investigate safety issues that are regularly raised. In addition, new avenues for researchers and practitioners are suggested to consider the social exchange relationships at construction sites. Using the validated PCS model and understanding the level of fulfillment, construction supervisors may influence workers' behavior with greater confidence. Furthermore, when finding a low level of fulfillment of PCS, senior managers can deliver training to supervisors to improve their safety behavior to the benefit of WSB.","[Newaz, Mohammad Tanvi; Davis, Peter; Jefferies, Marcus] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Pillay, Manikam] Univ Newcastle, Sch Hlth Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia","Jefferies, M (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",marcus.jefferies@newcastle.edu.au,"; , Manikam/H-4981-2015","Newaz, Mohammad Tanvi/0000-0003-3037-1120; , Manikam/0000-0002-7010-277X",,,,121,6,6,17,62,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The safety climate serves as an outline of the basic safety culture's features and forewarns on safety-related problems. This study aims to investigate safety climate information in international construction projects, and find out specific factors affecting perceptions of safety climate in an international context. A questionnaire survey was administered on five construction sites contracted by Chinese international contractors. A total of 571 valid questionnaires were collected from this survey. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis reveals that nationality, religious beliefs, and employment mode can significantly affect perceptions of safety climate from different facets. In the present case, Chinese workers tend to have more positive perceptions of safety climate than their Vietnamese coworkers. Workers with religious beliefs tend to have more positive perceptions of safety climate than those without such beliefs. Finally, workers employed by subcontractors tend to have more positive perceptions of the safety climate than those employed directly by the main contractor. The findings identify the crucial factors affecting safety climate, which in turn enable practitioners to create a positive safety culture to enhance safety performance in international construction projects.","[Gao, Ran; Chan, Albert P.

However, there is a general reluctance to purchase construction insurance in China. The purpose of this paper is to develop an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) model to understand and predict contractors' construction insurance purchasing intention. Design/methodology/approach Quantitative data were collected through a questionnaire survey. The respondents comprise 130 project directors/managers and contract managers/administrators who were involved in or familiar with the construction insurance purchasing or managing. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings This study developed an extended TPB model to explain the contractors' intention formation. The results indicated that the insurance purchasing intention was mainly influenced by attitudes and subjective norm, rather than perceived behavioral control. The analyses also revealed that the added variables (risk perception and past experience) had a significant impact on the attitudes and perceived behavioral control. Originality/value This study identified the factors leading to Chinese contractors' low willingness to purchase construction insurance by extending the TPB model to the context of construction insurance purchasing. The extended TPB model may serve as a theoretical framework and basis for the Chinese contractors, insurers, and regulators to understand the root causes of contractors' low willingness to purchase construction insurance and make joint efforts to address the risks and insurance in the construction industry.","[Liu, Junying] Tianjin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Liu, Junying] Tianjin Univ, Construct Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yingbin] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Math, South Penrith, Australia","Feng, YB (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Math, South Penrith, Australia.",y.feng@uws.edu.au,,"Feng, Yingbin/0000-0002-3832-0152",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71202084],This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71202084).,,85,5,5,1,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

This paper examines the relationship between job satisfaction and quality of work-life (QWL) factors from the perspective of construction craft workers. The study analyzed data collected from 2002 to 2014 using the General Social Survey's (GSS) QWL questionnaire module. Thirty-four of the 78 QWL variables were found to have a significant correlation with the overall level of job satisfaction of construction craft workers. By using the exploratory factor analysis, five latent factorssafety priority and organizational effectiveness, fair rewards system, resource adequacy, physical and mental health, and job tenurewere extracted. The relative impact of the five latent factors on construction craft worker job satisfaction also was identified. The paper contributes to the overall body of knowledge by identifying latent factors of QWL that affect craft worker job satisfaction specific to the construction industry. The findings of the paper can serve as guidance for construction companies to formulate policies and practices that contribute to better QWL, which can result in improved craft worker job satisfaction, leading to better retention and job performance.

Several bidding models have been presented in the literature to help contractors make these two decisions; however, they mostly considered the perspective of one contractor bidding on a single project, obscuring the interaction and learning components among contractors and the observation of emergent bidding patterns at both individual and aggregate levels. This research uses an evolutionary approach to model construction-bidding market dynamics and study the effect of contractors' risk attitude on their markups, and on the long-term progression of bid prices under two bid-tendering approaches, namely the low and average bid methods. Simulation results showed that the most risk-tolerant contractors submit the lowest bid prices under the low-bid method and the highest prices under the average bid method. Moreover, the low-bid approach revealed long-term equilibrium in tendered prices whereas the average bid method reflected a gradual bid-price increase.

In this paper, trust is regarded as a mediator between power and cooperative performance. A model of the relationship between trust and power is developed and tested using the results of an empirical study based on a sample of Chinese contractors. The results show that an owner's expert power can influence a contractor's cognition- and affect-based trust in the owner and that coercive power has little direct impact on the formation of trust. However, coercive power is found to moderate the relationship between expert power and cognition-based trust, in that the relationship is more positive when the level of coercive power is lower. Moreover, affect-based trust has a significantly greater positive influence on cooperative performance than cognition-based trust. These findings are interpreted in light of Chinese culture, and provide some suggestions for how owners can exercise power to foster cooperation with their contractors.

However, the unstable international circumstance has enhanced the risks of this industry, where proper strategies are critical for the survival of international contractors. Based on organizational ecology theories, which initially stemmed from ecology and then introduced to business management and economics field, proper competitive positioning for international construction companies are investigated in this study. Niche width has been introduced as an indicator to reflect the resource utilization of international construction companies while location is defined as the contractors' distance from the market center. Using Engineering News-Record data on top 225 international contractors from 1992 to 2009, the U-shaped relationship between niche width and performance of contractor is proven in both product and geography dimensions, indicating the performance of contractors enhance with the expansion of niche width initially, and then subside. In addition, location shows significant effect on performance of international contractors. The proper location for contractors with narrow niche width is close to the geographic market center and far from the product market center; while the appropriate positions for contractors with wide niche width are opposite to those with narrow niche width. Although this research focuses mainly on top international contractors, the results may reflect the profile of the whole industry. Furthermore, the research method of this study could be replicated in other studies to enhance the understanding of the organizational competitive positioning in a complicated environment.","[Yang, Huan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Finance & Econ Res, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Chan, Albert P.

This study attempts to reconstruct project practitioner's perspectives regarding the essence of collaborative relationships. Applying Q-methodology, subjective opinions and reflections of 30 project practitioners from 19 owner and engineering-construction firms were systematically analyzed. The result suggests four distinct perspectives towards effective working relationships, namely a) shared team responsibility, b) execution focused team, c) joint capability and structure; and d) senior leadership pair. Across perspectives, all practitioners shared a belief that an effective owner contractor relationship should be based on affective trust, shared vision, and mutual attitudes such as open and honest communication, solution seeking instead of blaming, and senior management leadership. In contrast to prior research, long-term orientation and contractual functions were perceived to play a relatively limited role in improving owner contractor relationships. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Khosrowshahi, F",,,,"Khosrowshahi, Farzad",,,Enhanced project brief: structured approach to client-designer interface,ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Construction; Artificial intelligence; Design brief; Design development; Project strategy; SSADM,,"Purpose - The focus of this work is on the client-designer interface where decisions have significant impact over the lifecycle of the project. Therefore, the briefing stage is examined in the context of clients' needs which is divided into project-based strategy and broader clients' strategy. The purpose of this paper is to address the pitfalls in the briefing process which has been attributed to the shortcomings in the client-designer communication interfaces. This will be achieved by developing an automated brief generation framework. The research examines the efficiency of standard approaches to modelling and design, and the benefits that these methodologies have offered to the computer industry. The work reviews the similarities between the two industries and argues in support of the potential benefits in adopting a standard methodology in the construction industry. The structure upon which the framework is developed is based on system analysis and design methodology (SSADM) which has proven to be an effective platform used within the software development industry. Design/methodology/approach - SSADM is an established methodology within the software development industry. The paper will demonstrate that due to fundamental similarities between the construction and software development industries, SSADM is likely to offer a viable platform upon which an automated enhanced brief generation model is developed for use in the construction industry. The construction design and construction process will be mapped on SSADM high-level definition before focusing and honing on the design phase. The methodology for the development of the framework will be based on the rationalist approach of generating knowledge through reasoning leading to model-building. Findings - A model that is based on SSADM is proposed for the design development phase of construction projects. In order to shape the project strategy, the model considers the combined role of clients' requirements with organisation strategy and environmental factors. The paper has shown that it is feasible to increase the automation of the briefing process and enhanced the briefing output. The model here does not diminish the importance of direct communication between the client and the design team. It provides a more structured way of doing so, while taking advantage of vast array of data and technology in order to improve the brief outcome. Research limitations/implications - From practical perspective, the proposed framework is in its formative stage, thus requiring incremental refinement through several case studies. This is particularly true about the AI components of the system which typically rely on extensive data representing the real-case scenarios. Therefore, the work invites further research into the examination of various parts as well as the overall system. Practical implications - There are several ways by which construction projects are procured. There may be fluctuation in their rate of usage, but while there is no indication of any procurement option fading, new ones such as PPP and PFI are periodically introduced. The existence of this diversity is indicative of the fact that the industry tends to respond to problems rather than attempting to instigate a measured solution supported by theoretical underpinning. Subsequently, there have been suggestions of a communication and information discourse between actors and within processes involved in project lifecycle. This project is aimed at addressing the gap in the client-designer communication. The automated approach to brief generation will lead to better briefs while reducing ambiguities as well as the overhead associated with brief generation. Social implications - The quality of project brief has a significant impact on decisions at the design stage. In turn, these decisions will influence all phases of construction project lifecycle. The briefing session and requirement analysis of a construction project can be very difficult for inexperienced clients particularly for complex projects. Therefore, there is potential for the process of client-requirement-analysis to be optimised. The work promises to improve the quality of the briefing process, thus helping clients to realise their intended objectives and minimise resource waste. Originality/value - The work builds on the commonalities of the construction and software development industries and takes advantage of the advancements in the latter. In doing so, project quality is defined quantitatively which is used to develop project strategy in a three-dimensional space. The development of the model was also contingent upon enhancement of artificial neural network structure.","[Khosrowshahi, Farzad] Leeds Met Univ, Sch Built Environm & Engn, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England","Khosrowshahi, F (corresponding author), Leeds Met Univ, Sch Built Environm & Engn, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",fk@serenade.org.uk,,,,,,51,2,2,2,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

RUCs measure the mobility impacts of construction work zones on public roads. RUC metrics are typically used in construction phases to determine the project's incentives and disincentives. However, determining RUC can be challenging due to scarce traffic data availability, incomplete construction plans, and limited time to conduct analysis. In this paper, we use traffic microsimulation to estimate the RUC for each hour of a typical 24-h day using 11 construction cases in Dallas, Texas. Our primary contribution includes developing relationships between peak-hour RUC measures with respect to the total daily values. Such relationships would allow an estimation of the full day RUC based only on the analysis of the peak hour. The main results suggest that the peak-hour travel time as a fraction of the daily value is, on average, 8.2%, comparable to typical percentages of the peak-hour traffic volumes. Furthermore, the models for predictive relationships using construction scenario demand and capacity show high correlation coefficients, presenting a potential for the development of such relationships for roadway construction projects.

A simple computationally efficient method for the evaluation of the expected costs of failure due to ultimate and serviceability (i.e., spalling) limit states is described. Ratios between the expected costs of failure associated with spalling and with ultimate limit states have been estimated as a function of the time between repairs for different design specifications, environmental conditions, and discount rates. Using these results, in the cases when the expected cost of failure associated with ultimate limit states is quite significant compared to that due to spalling and hence, cannot be neglected in a life-cycle cost analysis can be easily determined. Optimum times between repairs, which minimize the total expected cost of failure, have been calculated as a function of the ratio between the failure costs for ultimate and serviceability limit states. The effect of other parameters such as concrete strength, thickness of the concrete cover, the discount rate, and exposure conditions on the optimum times between repairs has also been examined.","Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Struct Engn & Construct Management, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel","Val, DV (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Struct Engn & Construct Management, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",val@tx.technion.ac.il,,"Val, Dimitri V./0000-0002-9914-8704",Fund for the Promotion of Research at the Technion; Technion V.P.R.

Such consultant-assisted information systems projects differ from internal and outsourced IS projects in two important respects. First, the joint project team consists of members from client and consulting organizations that may have conflicting goals and incompatible work practices. Second, close collaboration between the client and consulting organizations is required throughout the course of the project. Consequently, coordination is more complex for consultant-assisted projects and is critical for project success. Drawing from coordination and agency theories and the trust literature, we developed a research model to investigate how interorganizational coordination could help build relationships based on trust and goal congruence and achieve higher project performance. Hypotheses derived from the model were tested using data collected from 324 projects. The results provide strong support for the model. Interorganizational coordination was found to have the largest overall significant effect on performance. However, its effect was achieved indirectly by building trust and goal congruence and by reducing technical and requirements uncertainty. The positive effects of trust and goal congruence on project performance demonstrate the importance of managing the client-consultant relationship in such projects. Project uncertainty, including both technical and requirements uncertainty, was found to negatively affect goal congruence and trust, as expected. This study represents a step toward the development of a new theory on the role of interorganizational coordination.","[Liberatore, Matthew J.] Villanova Univ, Dept Management & Operat Int Business, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Luo, Wenhong] Villanova Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat Syst, Villanova, PA 19085 USA","Liberatore, MJ (corresponding author), Villanova Univ, Dept Management & Operat Int Business, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",matthew.liberatore@villanova.edu; wenhong.luo@villanova.edu,,,,,,85,19,19,0,41,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

This study aims to explore indirect pathways that external stakeholders normally pursue to affect construction projects and to develop a framework of stakeholder-influencing pathways. The authors adopted abductive reasoning, using a preliminary framework. Based on the framework, four process-tracing case studies in the Vietnamese construction industry were conducted for data collection and analysis. Newspapers were the main source of data, complemented by interviews and other archive data, such as press releases, petitions, blog postings, and official documents. All cases confirmed the pathway through which stakeholders induce decision-makers to exert pressure related to a project. Also, some unanticipated results were found: first, two additional pathways, comprising two or three causally ordered mediators, can be employed to affect projects; second, stakeholders tend to use multiple influence pathways in which some actors, such as governmental authorities and the public, have a high rate of occurrence; and third, a mediator can be affected by more than one successor, whereas some mediators are capable of influencing various predecessors. Accordingly, the preliminary framework was revised to match the unanticipated results. This study explores a preliminary mechanism that transmits stakeholder influences to a project via multiple causally ordered actors. It is also the first comprehensive investigation into stakeholder influence pathways in the built environment. The findings can assist managers in stakeholder prioritization and anticipating their influences on projects.","[Tan Hai Dang Nguyen] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Chileshe, Nicholas; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen; Wood, Anthony] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Nat & Built Environm Res Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia","Nguyen, THD (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",tan_hai_dang.nguyen@mymail.unisa.edu.au,"Nguyen, Tan Hai Dang/AAU-3320-2021; Wood, Anthony/F-4675-2013; Chileshe, Nicholas/F-5482-2010; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen/F-4614-2013","Nguyen, Tan Hai Dang/0000-0002-6333-4361; Wood, Anthony/0000-0003-2206-1165; Chileshe, Nicholas/0000-0002-1981-7518; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen/0000-0001-9639-2624",,,,95,2,2,3,26,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

To achieve these objectives, an in-depth literature review was carried out and a questionnaire survey was conducted with 33 contractor firms as well. The survey results reported sharing of project risks as the top attractive factor of ICJVs and differences in culture and working style as the top negative factor. In addition, both foreign and local contractors considered partners disagree over some conditions in contract the most critical risk to the parties involving projects under ICJVs. While risk allocation was perceived to be very important for ICJVs, unclear division of responsibilities and risks and differences in culture and working styles could be the most significant obstacles against effective risk allocation among the parties.

Previous studies have been conducted to build up quantitative decision models for contractor pre-qualification, among them artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) have been proved to be desirable in solving the pre-qualification problem with regards to their higher accuracy and efficiency for solving the non-linear problem of classification. Based on the algorithm of SVM, multiple kernel learning (MKL) method was developed and it has been proved to perform better than SVM in other areas. Hence, MKL is proposed in this research, the capability of MKL was compared with SVM through a case study. From the result, it has been proved that both SVM and MKL perform well in classification, and MKL is more preferable than SVM, with a proper parameter setting. Therefore, MKL can enhance the decision making of contractor pre-qualification. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Lam, K. C.; Yu, C.

This research aims to examine the effect of asset specificity on contractors' opportunistic behavior (strong form and weak form), including exploring and comparing the governance effectiveness of contract and trust. The empirical results from a survey of 228 Chinese owners reveal that asset specificity has positive effects on contractors' strong and weak form opportunistic behavior, and the effect on weak form opportunistic behavior is stronger. The results further show that the impact of asset specificity on opportunistic behavior (strong form and weak form) reduces as contractual complexity increases. The effect of asset specificity on weak form opportunistic behavior decreases as trust strengthens. Accordingly, the findings manifest that effectiveness of contract was more prominent when moderating the relationship between asset specificity and strong form opportunistic behavior. These findings provide a nuanced and advanced understanding of whether complex contracts or high levels of trust are the more effective choices for governing opportunistic behavior and offer managerial suggestions for the parties involved in construction projects.","[Shi, Chenxi; Chen, Yongqiang; You, Jingya; Yao, Hongjiang] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China","You, JY (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",chenxishi94@tju.edu.cn; symbolpmc@vip.sina.com; jingya41@163.com; yhjtgif@163.com,"Yao, Hongjiang/AAC-2462-2019","Yao, Hongjiang/0000-0002-9375-5554","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71231006, 71572124]","The authors would like to acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) for its financial support for this research (Grants No. 71231006 and 71572124).

Information transparency brings a number of benefits but potentially influences contractors' interests by weakening their core competencies or preventing some unethical but lucrative practices from occurring. This may impede the extensive application of BIM. However, it still lacks a comprehensive research on this. This research aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the negative impact of BIM-enabled information transparency on contractors' interests and further on BIM adoption by conducting an anonymous questionnaire survey. The results show that 1) the transparency of construction techniques and methods can impair contractors' interests in the long run, but relevant information is almost not disclosed by BIM so far; 2) the transparency of construction resource, cost and time has an instant and direct impact on contractors' interests, but only resource-and-cost-related unethical practices are influenced by BIM; and 3) the transparency of construction quality and safety has little impact on contractors' interests and relevant unethical practices are almost not influenced by BIM. Besides, contractors are reluctant to share information or use BIM with owners, thus further impeding BIM adoption. Based on these results, this research also presents some implications for the improvement of current working processes among stakeholders in the BIM context to protect contractors' core competencies and prevent unethical practices. These findings are expected to promote the extensive use of BIM in the construction industry.","[Guo, Hongling; Yu, Run] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fang, Yihai] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic, Australia","Guo, HL (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Room 3-406E,West Main Bldg, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hlguo@tsinghua.edu.cn; yihai.fang@monash.edu,,"Fang, Yihai/0000-0002-9451-4947","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51578318, 51208282]; Tsinghua University-Glodon Joint Research Centre for Building Information Model (RCBIM)","We would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51578318, 51208282) as well as Tsinghua University-Glodon Joint Research Centre for Building Information Model (RCBIM) for supporting this research.

This is often attributed to the use of various foreign standards, which are substantially different from Chinese standards. There are limited studies that investigate the reasons why the difference in standards are creating this challenge. This study explores the reason for the difficulties by using a mixed method research with survey data collected from construction companies involving 170 experienced managers who were involved in 115 international projects. It also involved interviews with an additional 76 managers. The findings confirm that Chinese contractors perceived significant difficulties implementing international projects due to the lack of knowledge of the foreign standards. It is concluded that an enhanced understanding of foreign standards, particularly in Middle Eastern countries, will improve cost and time performances in international projects. Strategies of active learning, inter-organizational cooperation and adjustment of talent training mode are suggested for the international contractors to cope with the issue of standards implementation.

It also reduces the effectiveness of planning and decision making not only for the contractor but for all parties involved. The problem keeps occurring despite many attempts made over the years to improve cost estimation and forecasting methods. This paper focuses on analyzing cost overruns in Turkey and comparing the cost estimates produced using the traditional estimating method against cost forecasts produced using the reference class forecasting (RCF) method. RCF is used to predict the final cost of a project predicated on actual cost outcomes of accomplished similar projects in the same reference class. RCF has been so far used to address estimation bias in early project development before design is completed and before all risks are accounted for to help a client to produce a more realistic forecast of the final project cost. In this paper, however, it is used to produce a forecast of the final project cost based on the contract sum. The work described in the paper involves collection of contract sum and final project cost data from 420 completed building projects. In order to test the ability of RCF to produce realistic forecasts of projects' final costs, 75% of the data are used to produce the cost overruns distribution and to determine the required optimism bias uplift values for the building projects, while the other 25% of the data are used for testing the accuracy of the forecasts produced for the final costs of projects in the established reference class. The results have indicated that the required uplift values are in the range of 4 to 44%. For instance, if the acceptable chance of cost overrun is 50%, 65% of the test projects would have required only 4% uplift of the contract sum to produce accurate forecasts of the final costs. If, on the other hand, the acceptable chance of cost overrun is only 10%, 5% of the test projects needed to use a 44% uplift to enable more accurate final project cost forecasts for the contractor. Additionally, to check the accuracy of the test data results obtained through applicable optimism bias uplift values, three standard error measuresroot-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)are used.","[Bayram, Savas] Erciyes Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey; [Bayram, Savas; Al-Jibouri, Saad] Univ Twente, Dept Construct Management & Engn, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands","Bayram, S (corresponding author), Erciyes Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey.; Bayram, S (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Construct Management & Engn, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",sbayram@erciyes.edu.tr; s.h.s.al-jibouri@ctw.utwente.nl,"Bayram, Savas/AAN-9501-2021","Bayram, Savas/0000-0002-0153-6750",Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [2219],The authors would like to thank the Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) for the contribution to the corresponding author with the 2219-International Postdoctoral Research Scholarship Programme.,,25,2,2,2,26,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Although some research has tried to establish a direct relationship between a contractor selection strategy and project outcomes, there is hardly any empirical research that tries to establish this relationship. This paper presents a quantifiable method of assessing the risk of selecting different contractor selection strategies using educational facilities projects in the United Kingdom. A Monte Carlo-simulation study was conducted to assess how the lowest-priced contractor would have fared against the best-value contractor had the former been awarded the contract instead. It was concluded that selecting the best-value contractor in educational facilities projects is not necessary in terms of cost. Furthermore, although the results are limited to educational facilities project, the method can be adapted to other sectors.","[Eke, Gerald] ProU Ltd, Data Analyt & Software Co, Innovat Birmingham Campus, Birmingham B7 4BB, W Midlands, England; [Elgy, John] Aston Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Wedawatta, Gayan] Northumbria Univ, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Newcastle NE1 8ST, England","Eke, G (corresponding author), ProU Ltd, Data Analyt & Software Co, Innovat Birmingham Campus, Birmingham B7 4BB, W Midlands, England.",gue.eke@gmail.com; j.elgy@aston.ac.uk; gayan.wedawatta@northumbria.ac.uk,"Wedawatta, Gayan/AAN-8579-2020","Wedawatta, Gayan/0000-0002-8600-5077",,,,31,4,4,0,26,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

This study examined in which construction phase (before or after contract execution) contractors discover document deficiencies, when owners learn of and resolve document deficiencies, and how document deficiencies affect project cost and duration. Data from 159 contractors and project owners indicate that 38% of all construction document deficiencies are discovered by the low-bid contractor before the owner has executed the contract. Conversely, owners reported learning of document deficiencies only 19% of the time before contract execution and 81% of the time after contract execution. These findings suggest a delay in communication between contractors and owners, resulting in asymmetrical information-a practice that industry professionals are aware of but that is often not openly discussed. This knowledge motivated contractors to delay reporting the deficiencies until after the contract was awarded. Furthermore, road projects and constructability concerns were found to be significantly associated with increased project costs.","[Pesek, Anthony E.] POB 873005, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Smithwick, Jake B.] Univ N Carolina, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28213 USA; [Saseendran, Anusree; Sullivan, Kenneth T.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, POB 873005, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA","Smithwick, JB (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28213 USA.",Anthony.Pesek@outlook.com; Jake.Smithwick@uncc.edu; asaseend@asu.edu; Kenneth.Sullivan@asu.edu,"Smithwick, Jake/AAZ-9427-2021","Smithwick, Jake/0000-0002-6260-3670",,,,57,6,6,0,30,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

When contractors are subjected to regular performance feedback, instead of just taking remedial action, they may take the opportunities to enhance their operations in the light of the feedback. Thus, it has been advocated that responding to performance feedback has a learning element. This study takes on this notion and examined the performance change pattern of contractors that have been subjected to regular performance feedback. Longitudinal performance scores were fitted against five well established learning curve models using the Least Square Curve Fitting Analysis (LSCFA). It was found that the 3-parameter hyperbolic model is the 'best-fit' model in terms of effectiveness and stability. The LSCFA results also suggested that the contractors in the sample can be arranged in four clusters: Competent Learners, Incidental Learners, Indifferent Learners and Optimizers. The majority of them fall into the optimizing cluster. This suggests that these contractors may adjust their resources to maintain their performance at an acceptable level which do not deprive their future opportunities. With due caveat to the constraints and limitations of working sample, this finding is thought provoking for project managers in exercising project monitoring. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

In order to avoid the selection of an incapable contractor, the capabilities of contractors must be assessed prior to tendering through pre-qualification. However, the pre-qualification process is characterized by partiality and ambiguity. In view of this, numerous models have been developed to solve the pre-qualification problems. Prior to the development of such models, it is very important to assess how the pre-qualification criteria impact project success criteria so as to aid in the selection of pre-qualification criteria while considering the project and client's objectives. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to ascertain the relationship between contractors' pre-qualification criteria and project success criteria. Design/methodology/approach The study utilized explanatory research design in testing 35 hypotheses. The views of 121 practising quantity surveyors were solicited using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modeling to validate the hypothesis. Findings In all, 13 of the 35 hypotheses were not supported. The findings indicated a clear relationship between contractors' pre-qualification and project success. Practical implications Therefore, it is evident that the practice of lowest evaluate bidder is not adequate for providing a satisfactory project outcome. It is, therefore, suggested that more emphasis should be placed on contractor's technical abilities, health and safety and management capabilities as they have proven to have a significant correlation with the project success. Originality/value This study provides insights to the how various pre-qualification criteria can impact the project success criteria and further contributes to the symbiotic that exist in the literature on pre-qualification and project success.","[Acheamfour, Victor Karikari; Kissi, Ernest; Adjei-Kumi, Theophilus] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Kumasi, Ghana","Kissi, E (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Kumasi, Ghana.",kisernest@gmail.com,"KISSI, ERNEST/AAS-1494-2020","KISSI, ERNEST/0000-0002-1975-3382",,,,60,5,5,1,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Master builders were generally charged with both design and construction services for a project. During the last half of the 20th century, many different systems for project delivery with fragmented responsibilities have replaced the master builder system. Reducing the use of the master builder system has led to the creation of elaborate systems for managing projects in the construction industry. In order to investigate the use of the master builder delivery system and other systems, a research project was conducted that included reviewing (1) the history of the construction industry, (2) project delivery systems, (3) constructability issues, (4) construction industry fragmentation, (5) the results of a survey of architecture, engineering, and construction professionals from the San Francisco Bay Area in California on the current processes they use for training engineers and architects, (6) an analysis of the survey results, (7) construction industry recommendations, and (8) conclusions based on the survey results and analysis. The information obtained from the research project, including the survey and an analysis of the results, is included in this document.

This study aims to explore the formation paths of international competitive advantages (ICAs) for HSR contractors. Through a comprehensive literature review, this paper firstly identified the 10 categories of 21 factors at the three covering levels (industry, firm, and project levels) that affect the ICAs of HSR contractors. The factors, categories, hypothetical paths model, and the preliminary questionnaire were refined and verified by the pilot study. Then the proposed paths model was verified through the methods of the partial least squares structural equation modeling and postsurvey interviews. The result validated the 10 significant ICAs paths (named the locomotive model), which could be further classified into two groups: the economic performance-oriented paths and the international reputation oriented paths. Moreover, the result showed the fundamental roles of the industrial triangle engine to the ICAs. This paper contributes to the competitive advantage theory in the field of international HSRs by proposing a verified locomotive model, which is important for the HSR practitioners to recognize in forming paths of ICAs and further developing their competitive strategic plans.","[Niu, Yanliang] Shijiazhuang Tiedao Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 15 Beierhuan East Rd, Shijiazhuang 050043, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xianbo] Cent Queensland Univ, Sch Engn & Technol, 400 Kent St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Wang, Yilin] East Univ Heilongjiang, Inst Construct Engn, 1 Hanan 19 Rd, Harbin 150066, Peoples R China; [Deng, Xiaopeng] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, 2 Southeast Univ Rd, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China","Deng, XP (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, 2 Southeast Univ Rd, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.",niuyanliang@stdu.edu.cn; b.zhao@cqu.edu.au; 349444566@qq.com; dxp@seu.edu.cn,"Zhao, Xianbo/H-1540-2017","Zhao, Xianbo/0000-0003-0153-5173","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [72071133, 71771052, 71972018]; Research Project on Humanities and Social Sciences of Hebei Higher Education Institutions (Top Young Scholar Project) [BJ2019079]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Hebei Universities [SQK202002]; Natural Science Foundation of HebeiNatural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [G2019210226]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province [2020A1414010317]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 72071133, 71771052, and 71972018); the Research Project on Humanities and Social Sciences of Hebei Higher Education Institutions (Top Young Scholar Project) (Grant No. BJ2019079); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Hebei Universities (Grant No. SQK202002); the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei (Grant No. G2019210226); and Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2020A1414010317).",,91,1,1,20,20,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

Given the complexity of such projects, the successful management of sustainability-related targets requires joint efforts from the major stakeholders involved, including project clients, contractors, suppliers, and the general public. Nevertheless, these stakeholders often have different, and sometimes even conflicting, concerns regarding the achievement of project sustainability. Confrontations and disputes can arise unless these concerns are carefully analyzed and addressed. However, we know little specifically about how major stakeholders perceive infrastructure sustainability and how their concerns differ in the three dimensions of project sustainability: economic, environmental, and social sustainability. This study investigated the major concerns of stakeholders in achieving sustainability in a typical infrastructure project (i.e., railway projects). A triangulated methodology was adopted, including a literature review, a questionnaire survey, and interviews to obtain data from project stakeholders. Based on the results, there was a significant divergence of views among stakeholder groups, and conflicts arose when there was a mismatch between stakeholders' perceptions. A list of major concerns from each individual stakeholder group was ranked and discussed. Some measures for promoting the consensus on achieving project sustainability among different stakeholder groups were also provided. The study not only provides insights into understanding differences in the concerns of major stakeholder groups in achieving railway project sustainability, it also helps develop quantitative approaches for measuring the degree of consensus and conflict among major stakeholder groups so as to minimize their concern differences.","[Yuan, Hongping] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Yuan, HP (corresponding author), Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",hpyuan2005@gmail.com,,"Yuan, Hongping/0000-0002-2383-4249",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71573216]; Sichuan Science and Technology Program [2017ZR0150]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [26816WCX01],"The study is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71573216), the Sichuan Science and Technology Program (2017ZR0150), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (26816WCX01).",,44,11,11,10,40,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",8756-9728,1938-9507,,PROJ MANAG J,Proj.

The present study seeks to establish a relationship between project defect score (pds), representing the quality of construction in the project, and the COQ in the building construction industry. The study also seeks to estimate the contributions of the various components to the overall COQ in the construction industry, along with their distribution and interrelationships among themselves. Design/methodology/approach A framework for estimating COQ was developed, and the data regarding prevention, appraisal and failure cost were collected from 122 projects. Various mathematical and statistical tools like Pearson's correlation, multiple linear regression (MLR) and curve fitting have been used for data analysis. Findings The prevention-appraisal-failure (PAF) model was found to be appropriate to estimate COQ, and the prevention, appraisal, conformance cost (CC) and failure cost were found to vary between 0.19 and 8%, 0.05 and 5%, 0.3 and 10% and 0.01 and 5%, respectively, whereas the overall COQ varied from 3.5 to 10.01% of the project cost. The correlations between various components of COQ were found to be significant. MLR suggested that appraisal cost is more impactful in reducing failure cost than prevention cost. Using curve fitting, the cubic model appropriately represented all interrelationships. The optimal overall COQ was found to be 3.86%, and the reasons for low COQ have been explored. Originality/value The study evaluates the applicability of available models for COQ calculations for the construction industry and presents a framework to estimate its components.

Searching for such an optimal combination of construction methods needs to evaluate the total cost, time and quality of the project. These performances, especially the quality, may be collected and recorded in terms of imprecise or vague data rather than precise numbers. This paper presents a fuzzy-multi-objective particle swarm optimization to solve the fuzzy TCQT problem. The time, cost and quality are described by fuzzy numbers and a fuzzy multi-attribute utility methodology incorporated with constrained fuzzy arithmetic operations is adopted to evaluate the selected construction methods. The particle swarm optimization is applied to search for the TCQT solutions by incorporating the fuzzy multi-attribute utility methodology. The proposed methodology is implemented and justified through computational analyses. The study is expected to provide an alternative methodology for solving the time-cost-quality tradeoff problem.

The work tasks of all these different co-builders need to be aligned to allow for the efficient delivery of the product. To allow for smooth alignment, all co-builders work together in the planning phase to rule out unwanted conflicts between work activities. Despite these efforts, many projects still accrue costs forced by on-site conflicts that were not anticipated beforehand and require costly improvisation to be resolved. The potential of 4D CAD models to avoid costly on-site improvisation by providing possibilities to anticipate conflicts better in the planning phase has been widely acknowledged. However, little empirical evidence exists that illustrate these benefits. This paper provides such evidence by providing in-depth narratives of how 4D CAD models helped to foresee conflicts on a major railway station renovation project in the Netherlands. These narratives describe in detail how practitioners on the case study successfully used 4D CAD models to coordinate their construction engineering designs, their construction schedules, and their construction operations. With these findings, the paper contributes to 4D literature by providing empirical case-based evidence for the benefits of applying 4D CAD models to plan construction work (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A new contractor prequalification decision model using SVM is proposed to assist clients to identify qualified contractors for tendering in this study. A case study was used to validate the proposed decision model and the classification ability was compared with neural networks (NNs) and principal component analysis (PCA). The results show that the proposed SVM model outperforms NN and PCA and the merits of using SVM to mitigate the limitations of using NN are elaborated.

Much depends on the nature of their engagement. The stakeholder engagement process can be complex and unpredictable, more so if no strategic plan is put in place or if no systematic thinking is invested in the innovation. Stakeholder engagement in the innovation process in general and innovation diffusion in particular is examined in the context of construction. From a theoretical perspective, analysis of the effect of stakeholders could be expected to help in refining the innovation process so that it produces decisions and outcomes more likely to lead to successful innovation and diffusion. To cover diverse applications from product development to the drafting and implementation of national standards, 19 innovation projects were studied. Through a statistical analysis of stakeholder involvement, based on a Fisher's exact test, it was concluded that a structured process of engagement has to be an integral part of the innovation process. Accordingly, an explicit plan for communication and engagement with identified key stakeholders is necessary ex ante as a condition for successful innovation and diffusion.

Most previous studies in construction project risk management have been focusing on the factors contributing to the success of risk management, but little attention was given to factors significantly affecting decision makers' risk attitudes in construction projects. To improve RBDM, we investigate the critical factors affecting contractors' risk attitudes in construction projects in China in this research. Literatures reviews, interviews and questionnaires are used for the identification of factors affecting contractors' risk attitudes. Statistical methods of ranking analysis and factor analysis are also implemented for verification and further analysis. The results show that the most important three factors are: consequences of decision making, engineering experience, and completeness of project information. Results from factor analysis on the identified critical factors reveal that they can be grouped into four categories, namely: (1) knowledge and experience; (2) contractors' character; (3) personal perception; and (4) economic environment. The significance of this research is that the findings do not only provide decision making support for contractors by deepening their understandings of the factors that affect their risk attitudes, but also serve as a useful reference for further studies under this topic.

Also, the proposed system is capable of generating an automated linear schedule based on stochastic scheduling techniques. Thus, a meta-heuristic simulated approach utilizing a metropolis algorithm is implemented to assist in generating optimized line-of balances. The successful implementation of the proposed system will provide the user with optimum fleet of equipment for performing earthwork operations and linear scheduling for strategic planning purposes. Towards the end, an actual dam construction project is utilized to numerically validate the proposed system and quantify its degree of accuracy. Results presented in this study are anticipated to be of major significance to owners, designers, and construction managers specialized in embankment dams heavy earthmoving operations and would contribute to the database of fleet management systems by incorporating a novel system that integrates heavy equipment economical operational analyses with its corresponding line of balance.","[Markiz, Nizar; Jrade, Ahmad] Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Markiz, N (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",nmark086@uottawa.ca,,,,,,15,1,1,1,15,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

One way in which building firms can use social media is as a customer relationship management (CRM) tool to improve customer engagement and satisfaction (known as social CRM). In order to explore how social CRM (SCRM) can be used, and is being used by building firms, semi-structured interviews with accredited building practitioners were utilized to collect data on SCRM use in the sector. The data were analysed to determine the factors that influence social media use, the extent of SCRM use, and the ways in which building contractors are using SCRM. It was found that builders are using social media to manage client relationships, but to a limited extent due to the complex nature of the builder-client relationship and a lack of perceived trustworthiness. Building firms favoured a transactional approach to social media use, and preferred not to use formal social media strategies. Builders are also reluctant to use social media to assist them in segmenting customers by their value to the firm. For effective social media use, builders may consider two main issues: SCRM strategy and customer-value segmentation to develop profitable customer relationships.","[Swarts, Kevin M.; Lehman, Kim; Lewis, Gemma K.] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia","Swarts, KM (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia.",kevin.swarts@utas.edu.au,"; Lehman, Kim/J-7146-2014","Swarts, Kevin/0000-0002-0421-0406; Lehman, Kim/0000-0002-1652-4701",,,,77,4,4,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

By collecting cost and schedule data at three key milestones (decision to build, contract awarding and substantial completion) from 39 traditional projects and 27 P3 projects across Canada between 2004 and 2016, the study develops an innovative longitudinal profiling approach to inform the debate about the causes of cost overruns in large public projects. Statistical analyses of the collected data unambiguously demonstrate that P3s outperform non-P3 traditional delivery models during the construction stage in both cost overrun and schedule delay. However, substantial budget underestimation is found in the strategic decision-making process of both models of project delivery.

The purpose of this paper is to study a nonpreemptive scheduling problem on a single-machine to minimize the total tardiness and total energy cost under time-of-use electricity tariffs, which is a mixed-integer multi-objective mathematical programming model. To achieve these objectives, we develop several new holistic genetic algorithms. The proposed model is solved via several methods including weighted sum method and multiobjective genetic algorithms based on dominance rank (GA-1), weighted sum aggregation (GA-2), dominance ranking procedure and crowding distance comparison (GA-3), and heuristic approach (GA-H). This paper illustrates that operations management, which is typically observed as a significant technique that allows manufacturing to operate in challenging data enabled environment in an industrial internet of things ecosystem, can also carefully optimize a production process to improve energy cost in order to manage environmental challenges. Thus, the findings provide information on when to start each job. We provide detailed experimental results evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithms. In a case study, we illustrate how the results of the multiobjective model could be utilized in decision making using the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method.","[Rubaiee, Saeed] Univ Jeddah, Dept Ind Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Cinar, Suna] Istanbul Tech Univ, Technol Transfer Off, TR-34467 Istanbul, Turkey; [Yildirim, Mehmet Bayram] Wichita State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Wichita, KS 67260 USA","Rubaiee, S (corresponding author), Univ Jeddah, Dept Ind Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.",salrubaiee@uj.edu.sa; cinarsuna@yahoo.com; bayram.yildirim@wichita.edu,"Rubaiee, Saeed/T-8560-2019","Rubaiee, Saeed/0000-0002-4433-5529",U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)United States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-EE0007719],This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Award DE-EE0007719.,,47,11,12,4,36,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

The objectives are to understand the translating process of specific enterprise demands to the evaluating criteria and the weight calculation process. Design/methodology/approach A three-stage model of subcontractor selection was designed based on quality function deployment (QFD), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and improved grey correlation analysis (IGCA). In the proposed model, specific enterprise demands are translated by the QFD method, and the weights of the criteria are determined by the IGCA. The AHP is used to quantify the exporters' experience and construct the judgment matrix, which is used as inputting of the grey correlation analysis. Findings The proposed model provides a feasible process for subcontractor selection by fully considering the actual requirements of the project. By combining the company requirements and project requirement to put forward the requirements of the target subcontractor, the selection process ensures that the selected subcontractor and the project have a higher fit Originality/value Few researches on construction subcontractor selection have taken into account the voice of the company's stakeholders. Therefore, this paper designs a three-stage construction subcontractor selection model by introducing QFD to achieve the transmission of voice in the subcontractor selection process, so as to take full consideration of the project objectives and the needs of the company's stakeholders. Meanwhile, in order to decrease the subjective of weight calculation, this paper designs an AHP-IGCA allocation method to determine the weight of relevant indicators. By integrating the proposed weight calculation method and QFD method, the subcontractor selection results become more reasonable and objective.","[Chen, Xiaobo; Ding, Yanfeng; Hu, Yingwen; Feng, Xiaoyi] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Investment & Construct Management, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Cory, Clark A.] Purdue Univ, Comp Graph Technol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Wu, Kuo-Jui] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Taipei, Taiwan","Chen, XB (corresponding author), Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Investment & Construct Management, Dalian, Peoples R China.",xbchen@dufe.edu.cn; 1547040013@qq.com; ccory@purdue.edu; 944969607@qq.com; garykjwu@gmail.com; m15542352122@163.com,"Wu, Kuo-Jui/N-1926-2019","Wu, Kuo-Jui/0000-0002-6246-8245",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71701033]; Dalian high level Talents Innovation Support Plan [2017 RQ005]; Research project of department of education of Liaoning Province [LN2020Q04],"This research has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grants No. 71701033, the Dalian high level Talents Innovation Support Plan No. 2017 RQ005, and the Research project of department of education of Liaoning Province (LN2020Q04).",,52,3,3,4,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Design/methodology/approach Factors were explored by a literature review and an open-ended questionnaire survey. In total, 9 hypotheses involving 12 factors were developed accordingly. Then a structured questionnaire survey was conducted, and 248 valid questionnaires were received from Chinese contractors. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was employed to test the hypotheses. Findings Factors that have the largest impacts on the contractual approach and the relational approach regarding obliging and compromising are favourability of evidence, time pressure and reputation, respectively. Unexpected results show that obliging behaviours are negatively correlated with procedural fairness but positively correlated with occurrence time of the dispute. Originality/value This study furnishes a nuanced picture of multiple factors' impacts on contractors' behavioural strategies of claim-related dispute resolution, and thus supplements the relevant construction dispute management literature. From the perspective of contractual governance, it is one of those exploring drivers of contract application in problem situations. It extends the body of knowledge on this topic and hopefully will encourage more research on contractual governance from the reactive perspective.","[Zhang, Lihan; Fenn, Peter] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Fu, Yongcheng] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England","Zhang, LH (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England.",lihan.zhang@manchester.ac.uk,,"Fenn, Peter/0000-0002-8090-7272; Zhang, Lihan/0000-0002-8092-2632; Fu, Yongcheng/0000-0002-4161-2375",University of Manchester; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council,The authors are grateful for the financial support from the University of Manchester and the China Scholarship Council.,,89,7,7,2,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

To address this gap, we conducted a study at two office sites. Four IEQ parameters (carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity, and illuminance) were continuously monitored at each site, and brief environmental comfort surveys were sent to employees' smartphones four times per day across the study period. In total, 45 employees across the two sites completed 536 surveys. The findings confirm that the repeated sampling approach is a more appropriate method for measuring comfort than a questionnaire delivered at one time only. Adherence to recommended temperatures reduced the risk of thermal discomfort, however this effect was weak and other predicted associations between the physical environment and environmental comfort were not supported. The results also showed a strong association between environmental comfort and self-rated productivity, such that employees rated themselves as most productive when they were satisfied with noise levels, temperature, air quality, and lighting within the office. Overall, the results highlight that it is critically important to consider strategies for optimising occupant comfort, although this is unlikely to be achieved through adherence to environmental comfort boundaries alone.","[Roskams, Michael J.; Haynes, Barry P.] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Dept Nat & Built Environm, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","Roskams, MJ (corresponding author), Sheffield Hallam Univ, Dept Nat & Built Environm, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",m.roskams@shu.ac.uk,"Haynes, Barry P/R-1130-2018","Haynes, Barry P/0000-0003-3740-4159; Roskams, Michael/0000-0003-4956-0335","UK Research and Innovation, Innovate UKUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UK","The primary author for this paper is employed as a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) Associate on a project funded by the UK Research and Innovation, Innovate UK.",,46,4,4,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

A general model is presented with which activities and their buffers can be mathematically described in detail. The algorithm of the new method forms the body of the paper, including the steps of setting up initial equations, calculating pairwise differences between them, differentiating these to obtain the location of any minima, and deriving the final equations. The algorithm consolidates the linear schedule under consideration of all constraints and, thus, automatically generates the minimum overall project duration.

While clients strive hard to make the best decisions in selecting the right contractor for the right job, a clear understanding of the underlying attributes associated with contractors' selection in the context of achieving, successful project outcomes is critical. In an attempt to understand these pre-emptive qualification criteria and their links to contractors' performance on a project, a hierarchical structural model is established. By employing the structural equation modelling technique, the model adapts a total of 29 technical attributes across five confirmatory factors namely, soundness of business and workforce (SBW), planning and control (PC), quality performance (QP), past performance (PP) and overall project success (OPS). Based on the survey data collected across medium size construction projects in Australia, the results of the model confirmed that technical planning and controlling expertise of contractor is key in achieving success on projects. With a clear understanding of the significance of these factors in the context of contractors' performance, these findings could potentially contribute to the development of a company's procedures or to enhance existing knowledge of contractor prequalification practices.

Findings from this study show that all 15 selected CSFs are regarded as critical by most respondents for the success of stakeholder management in construction projects. The factor regarding social responsibilities is considered most important for managing stakeholders. Although correlations between CSFs and types of projects and organizations were statistically significant, these were not particularly strong. Also, even though there is a general consensus on the rankings of the CSFs among different respondents, the detailed pairwise comparisons actually show the existence of a few differences in perceptions on the relative importance of the CSFs. Therefore, the working priorities of project managers for managing stakeholders are context specific, depending on the nature, client sector, and cost of the project, and also on their organizations and management levels in the organization.

The aim is to provide insights for both industry practitioners and academics concerning what worked and what did not work and to discuss barriers to avoid when taking academic concepts to industry. What makes this paper unique is that we are following the developments inside one company, Skanska Finland, uninterrupted for over a decade. Dr Glenn Ballard was closely involved in the developments and deployments throughout the journey. The paper confirms earlier findings of managing variability prior to other process improvements. At the same time, it is important to understand the minimum organisational level needed when developing and deploying lean methods. During our journey, the most successful deployment was the Last Planner System (R); it has been both robust against market turns but also it has been possible to deploy it project-by-project. Thus, there is no need to wait until the whole company or a large part of it has understood the concept before deployment can start. Supplier development requires a wider scope than just a single project or the duration of a project for successful deployment. The weak or less sustainable deployment of logistics solutions in the construction industry may be because it requires industry-level technology standardisation and data platforms.","[Elfving, Jan A.] Skanska, Nauvontie 18, Helsinki 00101, Finland","Elfving, JA (corresponding author), Skanska, Nauvontie 18, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",jan.elfving@skanska.fi,,,,,,40,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Although previous studies have presented different methodologies for contractor selection, the subject of contractor selection remains attractive to many researchers. This paper enhances the construction management profession by introducing a new contractor selection method that incorporates multiple decision-makers. This paper introduces a quantitative fuzzy-set method to assist in the contractor selection process by implementing multiattribute decision-making that integrates a group of decision makers. Although the preferred attributes that contribute to contractor selection are dependent on the project, the method presented in this paper can be implemented for any attributes determined important to contractor selection in a specific case. The method introduced in the research reported in this paper is intended to help decision makers rank different contractors based on various attributes. The triangular fuzzy-set model is implemented to define the linguistic terms used to describe subjective judgment related to decision makers' experience level, attribute weight assessment, and selection attributes rating. Many uncertainties and ambiguities arise in contractor selection as this decision is a multiattribute group decision with time pressure; therefore, the fuzzy weighted-average method can be used to simulate the grouping of multiple decision-makers. The research reported in this paper models different levels of experience for decision makers involved in the evaluation process (up to 10 decision-makers) using fuzzy membership functions to express their experience level. Different decision-makers input their beliefs about the importance of a set of attributes that contribute to the decision to prequalify a given contractor using linguistic terms, which are converted into membership functions. The decision makers rate different contractors (up to five contractors) using linguistic terms, which are converted into membership functions that represent the degree to which decision makers believe a contractor meets the set of criteria important to the prequalification decision. The results of the research reported in this paper provide project stakeholders with valuable insights into the contractor selection problem. A computer program which uses the fuzzy-logic approach to modeling the multiattribute decision-making process is introduced. This program can be implemented by stakeholders to make better contractor-selection decisions. This computer program has been validated by five developers in a real case study. The results of the computer program agreed with the actual contractor selected by the developers of the project. The new contribution of this paper lies in the fact that it implements subjective judgment using fuzzy logic in the contractor selection decision and introduces multiple decision-makers into the quantitative solution introduced in the research reported in this paper.

The process of selection is subjected to uncertainty and influence of criteria other than bid price. This paper presents an approach to prioritize competitive contractors at the prebidding stage for highway projects by utilizing the analytic network process (ANP) and Monte Carlo simulation. Both techniques are integrated on a single platform to build the proposed model. Initially, the main quantitative and qualitative criteria affecting the contractors' selection process are identified and studied. The effective criteria in the selection process were obtained from experts and literature. A structured questionnaire was designed and sent to experts in highway projects. The ANP was used to prioritize these criteria subsequently, and Monte Carlo simulation was utilized to develop the selection model. The applicability of the proposed model was tested using four real cases of highway projects. It was concluded that using the lowest bid price as a sole criterion for selecting the best contractors may not result in an optimum solution.

The purpose of this paper is to identify and rank decision factors considered by variously sized Chinese international contractors (CICs) and categorize those groups of factors important to experienced practitioners. Design/methodology/approach The analysis of factors identified by a literature review is conducted based on data derived from questionnaire results received from 119 CIC project and bidding managers. The relative importance of factors is measured by mean value and standard deviation. The discrepancy in rank and importance value perceived by variously sized CICs are explored by ranking disparity analysis, non-parametric test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient test. Finally, factor analysis is used to categorize the underlying groups of factors considered by CICs. Findings In sum, 41 factors are identified through the literature review as having an impact on the bid decision. Significant disparities in ranking and importance are found in several factors, which partially affect the consistency of the ranking of factors perceived between large and small-medium CICs. Ultimately, nine major factors are identified as impacting the bidding decision, with contractor's capability and country risk of the host country, being the most important. Research limitations/implications The weight of a factor considered in a decision varies across contractors as a function of contractor size. Whether using models or subjective judgment in making decisions, it is beneficial to fully understand the main groups of factors influencing the decision. Vulnerability to country risk emerges as the first criterion accessed in the bid decision. Originality/value A comprehensive set of factors is established for CICs, including both general factors common to domestic projects, and international factors unique to international projects. All factors are grouped by inferential analysis from the perspective of contractors, which reveals the underlying mechanism of the bid decision-making process. While the data were collected from CICs, the methodology in exploring factors, along with implications, is determined to be applicable internationally.","[Li, Guanghua; Chen, Chuan] Sichuan Univ, Business Sch, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Li, Guanghua] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Environm & Civil Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guomin] RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Martek, Igor] Deakin Univ, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Geelong, Vic, Australia","Chen, C (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Business Sch, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",liguanghua13@cdut.edu.cn; chuanc2012@126.com; kevin.zhang@rmit.edu.au; igormartek@yahoo.com,,"Zhang, Guomin Kevin/0000-0002-3503-7431; Li, Guanghua/0000-0001-5571-7509",,,,79,8,8,6,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Lack of a systematic approach to integrate input of a wide range of stakeholders in infrastructure planning results in the neglect of interactional dynamics and can overshadow the accuracy of project schedules and estimates. To address this lack, a systematic approach based on risk assessment is presented in this paper to gauge the relative impact of interactions on project outcomes based on the input of a wide range of stakeholders. With the primary objective of facilitating the input of stakeholders in infrastructure planning, the proposed approach aims to help project developers define and characterize the network of stakeholders in a specific project phase, assess relative importance of risks associated with the interactions based on the fuzzified input of a wide range of stakeholders, and integrate the results of the assessment into the project plans using social network analysis. A case study considering the preconstruction and construction phases of nuclear power plants was used to demonstrate the application of the proposed approach. High interactional risk levels were observed in various degrees of involvement, highlighting the high risk of overlooking actors with a low degree of involvement, such as the general public or a regulatory agency, in project planning. The results further indicate the dynamic nature of interactions in a project's lifetime because degrees of significance for stakeholder interactions changed in different phases of the project.","[Valentin, Vanessa] Univ New Mexico, Dept Civil Engn, MSC01 10701, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Naderpajouh, Nader] RMIT Univ, Royal Melbourne Inst Technol, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Abraham, Dulcy M.] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Valentin, V (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Civil Engn, MSC01 10701, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",vv@unm.edu; nnp@rmit.edu.au; dulcy@ecn.purdue.edu,"Naderpajouh, Nader/AAD-1525-2020","Naderpajouh, Nader/0000-0001-9628-9766",,,,90,18,18,7,69,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

The last two are combined to create the expected utility-based measurement. The results show that the risk ranking order obtained from the direct measurement strategy is significantly different from that obtained from the expected utility-based measurement. Moreover, the former measurement is in general a better predictive indicator of relative managerial input than the latter.

Although this recession is expected to be completed soon, many international contractors still have difficulty deciding on the strategies that are more effective during volatile market conditions. Korean contractors have already experienced one recession in recent times, instigated by the Asian financial crisis in 1997, and two boom economies before and after this recession. To investigate more effective strategies used in the overseas construction market, this study evaluates 31 Korean contractors' international performance over the different periods (boom, recession, and reboom) and analyses the effects of diversification, localization, strategic alliance, resources cost allocation, and financial soundness by using 14 key variables. The results showed that regional diversification had a profound effect on overcoming the recessionary periods. Localization was also strongly positive, specifically during the reboom period.

To address this issue, as an important concern in the project planning stage, this paper presents a group decision making framework to seek the optimal resource utilization, considering time, cost, and quality simultaneously. The framework, which has the capability of dealing with uncertainty, is the incorporation of the Monte Carlo simulation for stochastic measurements of time and cost, a fuzzy simple additive weighting system for stochastic estimation of quality, and the Borda-Ordered Weighted Averaging method for the group decision making process. In this framework, time, cost, and quality as separate decision makers, which could carry different levels of weight in the decision making process, are able engage their different perceptions of risk and confidence levels. A proposed satisfaction index measures the optimization levels of time, cost, and quality as satisfaction levels of each decision maker. A real project, used as an example of an application, is analyzed to illustrate the use of the framework and demonstrate its capabilities in stochastic optimization of time-cost-quality in construction projects.","[Heravi, Gholamreza; Faeghi, Shiva] Univ Tehran, Sch Civil Engn, Coll Engn, Tehran, Iran","Heravi, G (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Sch Civil Engn, Coll Engn, POB 11155-4563,16 Azar Ave, Tehran, Iran.",heravi@ut.ac.ir; sh.faeghi@ut.ac.ir,"Heravi, Gholamreza/B-8887-2017; Faeghi, Shiva/I-7711-2013","Heravi, Gholamreza/0000-0002-2727-4920; Faeghi, Shiva/0000-0002-2140-056X",,,,33,21,21,2,35,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0887-3801,1943-5487,,J COMPUT CIVIL ENG,J.

Previous studies have regarded the pricing of bidders as an optimum decision based on contractor's cost and market competition level. However, the sell to produce characteristic of construction projects may induce contractors to offer a low bid and then make up the amount initially sacrificed from beyond-contractual reward (BCR) gained through cutting corners and claims. System dynamics was adopted in this study to develop a contractor's pricing model with consideration of the dimensions of cost, market competition, and BCR. The model was then examined by statistical analysis of data collected from 44 highway projects in Taiwan. It was found that the equilibrium market price is significantly associated with BCR, which is assumed to be determined by the strictness of the owner's construction management, including both soundness of contract and tightness in construction supervision. Research results suggest that contractors divide the market into different segments according to the owner's strictness of construction management and the equilibrium price level of each market segment varies. The price level for projects with a strict owner is remarkably higher than for those with relatively less strict owners. Improvement in the construction management system of projects is crucial to lower the possibility that contractors gain BCR and do opportunistic bidding, and to further enhance project quality.","Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Tech, Dept Construct Engn, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan; Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Tech, Inst Engn Sci & tech, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan","Lo, W (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Tech, Dept Construct Engn, 1 Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan.",roylo@ccms.nkfust.edu.tw; ken@ccms.nkfust.edu.tw; u9015908@ccms.nkfust.edu.tw,,,,,,27,49,49,2,35,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

In the literature that deals with construction project success and causes of time and cost overruns in the construction industry, there is some literature that highlights the role of the contractors in project success. While most studies rank contractors' success attribute from tendering, prequalification, and a long term historical perception perspective, this paper aims to study the impact of contractors' attributes on project success from a post construction evaluation perspective to identify what critical success factors (CSFs) that greatly impact the success of project. In an attempt to understand and investigate this impact, a questionnaire survey is used to establish construction professionals' perception of CSFs of contractors that greatly impact on the success of construction projects. Factor analysis reveals nine underlying clusters namely :(i) safety and quality; (ii) past performance; (iii) environment; (iv) management and technical aspects; (v) resource; (vi) organisation; (vii) experience; (viii) size/type of pervious projects; and (ix) finance. Logistic regression techniques were used to develop models that predict the probability of project success. Factors such as turnover history, quality policy, adequacy of labour and plant resources, waste disposal, size of past projects completed, and company image are the most significant factors affecting projects success. Assuming that project success is repeatable, these findings provide clear understanding of contractors' performance and could potentially enhance existing knowledge of construction project success.

Simultaneously, construction contractor project managers are given freedom to run projects as if they were independent firms. If this is a motivating factor for the managers, firms may have to find other ways to improve productivity than to increase standardisation to be able to stimulate their most skilled managers. It could prove important to recognise their need for freedom before they start looking for alternative places of employment. The purpose of this article is to inquire how standardisation may or may not conflict with contractor project managers' sense of freedom. Interviews with 15 contractor project managers from Swedish medium-sized construction contractor enterprises indicate that standardised processes do not necessarily conflict with their sense of freedom and work motivation as long as their ability to overview the production process is preserved. Based on the findings it is argued that standardisation should be implemented and developed with respect from top managers using a bottom-up approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Design/methodology/approach Hypotheses indicating the positive relationships between stakeholders' effective attributes, stakeholder engagement as social network dynamics and project success through stakeholders' satisfaction have been developed. Based on a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews, responses have been gathered from the representative groups and organizations on their social network dynamics for their satisfaction and project success. A hypothesized structural equation model has been tested using AMOS statistical software package. Findings The analysis highlighted the engagement of the stakeholders within the strategic intents of the project with the public needs and expectations. The model depicts the processes of building social network models based on the capturing of the project's data in relation to the stakeholders' communication and satisfaction across the key issues for success in the lifecycle of MTIP. Practical implications The model is applicable on most MTIP with a diverse stakeholder base and the underlying complexity associated with the community participation and consultation processes. The model will also support wider stakeholder engagement in the planning of MTIP with optimal operationalization and service delivery from a community perspective. Originality/value The research involves an approach for rationalizing the stakeholder engagement policies of the MTIPs by providing an empirically grounded model simultaneously linking various aspects of stakeholder effective attributes, stakeholder engagement and their relationships to stakeholder satisfaction and project success in MTIPs.","[Erkul, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Yitmen, Ibrahim] Jonkoping Univ, Dept Construct Engn & Lighting Sci, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Yitmen, Ibrahim] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Celik, Tahir] Cyprus Int Univ, Nicosia, Northern Cyprus, Cyprus","Yitmen, I (corresponding author), Jonkoping Univ, Dept Construct Engn & Lighting Sci, Jonkoping, Sweden.; Yitmen, I (corresponding author), Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey.",m.erkul@yahoo.com; ibrahim.yitmen@ju.se; tcelik@ciu.edu.tr,,"Yitmen, Ibrahim/0000-0003-4288-9904",,,,134,4,4,13,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

We present an integration of theories and methods that has been successfully used in the extractive industries to maintain a high level of social license. We define the social license concept, noting its embeddedness in stakeholder theory and the resource dependence view of the firm, and how it has been elaborated enough to become measurable. Then we integrate it with social network analysis and methods for quantifying stakeholders' issues and concerns. Key benefits are the ability to identify minority clusters that have sufficient influence to dominate the majority and the specification of network interventions to raise the level of social license. We use an example of a proposed housing project to illustrate how the proposed approach produces practical stakeholder relations strategies for gaining and maintaining a social license to build.","[Boutilier, Robert G.] Simon Fraser Univ, Ctr Sustainable Community Dev, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Zdziarski, Michal] Univ Warsaw, Management Fac, Warsaw, Poland","Zdziarski, M (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Management Fac, Warsaw, Poland.",Mzdziarski@mail.wz.uw.edu.pl,,"Boutilier, Robert/0000-0002-5345-356X; Zdziarski, Michal/0000-0002-5911-0090",,,,139,21,21,5,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

The purpose of this paper is to present the diverse expectations of external stakeholder groups, i.e. governmental authorities, general public, and affected local communities, in construction projects. The practical steps to manage the expectations are also outlined. Design/methodology/approach - A three-stage methodology was adopted for the review. The primary terms stakeholder, project participants, or project environment were first searched in four popularly search engines and eight top journals that publish construction research to retrieve publications. After a second-stage filtering process, the selected data were then analyzed and reviewed in line with the objectives. Findings - In total, 49 common expectations were identified and classified. The results indicate that each stakeholder group pursues expectations in line with the social, environmental, and economic sustainability objectives. For effective management, project managers (PMs) must know stakeholder opportunities and threats, fulfill social responsibilities, establish common goals, apply appropriate strategies, and enhance stakeholder satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - The identified expectations are only based on the selected publications. Even though the expectations have been categorized in line with the triple bottom line model, the relative importance of the expectations cannot be ascertained since there is no empirical support. Practical implications - PMs can play safe by acknowledging the stakeholder expectations and employ such strategies to curtail resulting impacts and maximize mutual benefits. The list of expectations could also be used to promote equitable value optimization in projects, enhance needs fulfillment, and facilitate the evaluation of external stakeholder satisfaction. Originality/value - This study provides a comprehensive checklist of construction stakeholder expectations which hitherto, is lacked in the literature.

This study presents a data-driven approach to evaluating contractors' production performance on past highway projects, a critical but rarely considered aspect of current evaluation systems. Using historical daily work report data, actual production rates were calculated for controlling activities in past projects. These rates were classified into three tiers of contractor production performance; four contractor-independent factors, which influence rates, location, project budget, weather, and quantity of work, were considered by applying classification techniques, distribution fitting, and Monte Carlo simulation. Performance indexes were proposed in order to enable comparisons. The proposed framework allows project owners to evaluate contractors more objectively and comprehensively by considering an additional but critical criterion in the existing evaluation process, that is, contractors' past production performance.","[Le, Chau] Texas A&M Univ, Interdisciplinary Engn, 3137 TAMU,Francis Hall 321, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Jeong, H.

One issue that must be resolved before a public transportation agency can advertise a CMGC contract is whether or not to include price in the selection scheme, and if so, how much weight the price component will carry versus all other evaluation criteria. This paper discusses the results of research into this topic based on an analysis of the experience of 26 public transportation agencies on 36 CMGC projects in 14 U.S. states. The paper finds that there is a learning curve that can be mapped as the change in price factor weight over time as an agency gains experience with CMGC, and details that finding via a case study of the Utah Department of Transportation's CMGC program. The paper concludes that non-price factors, such as the CMGC contractor's approach to the preconstruction phase, are more important than price factors and should carry a greater weight in the evaluation plan. It also finds that weight accorded to price factors decreases as an agency gains CMGC experience. Finally, it recommends that agencies that are trying CMGC for the first time focus their selection scheme on factors that will reflect on a given contractor's ability to collaborate with the owner and designer during the preconstruction phases of the project rather than on obtaining the lowest price.","[Gransberg, Douglas D.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Construct Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Shane, Jennifer S.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Gransberg, DD (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Construct Engn, 494 Town Engn Bldg, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",dgran@iastate.edu; shane@iastate.edu,"Gransberg, Douglas/W-1731-2019","Gransberg, Douglas/0000-0002-5588-5024",National Cooperative Highway Research Program of the National Academies' Transportation Research Board,"The authors would like to acknowledge the National Cooperative Highway Research Program of the National Academies' Transportation Research Board for its support of this research.

Design/methodology/approach Building on classical organizational theory and GP knowledge areas, a survey addressing GP practitioners was designed. This paper focuses on OS practices as success factors and addresses a subset of the survey (1,170 respondents across 74 countries). Findings OS practices included in the study were found to have high importance for managerial success. OS practices for selection and training of team members show significant correlation with project efficiency but have low adaptation in many organizations. Statistically significant correlations were found to be weaker than expected, indicating that the relation between OS practices (as success factors) and project efficiency (as success criteria) is more complex than expected. Originality/value The theoretical alignment of classical organizational variables with GP knowledge areas and associated practices provides an original approach to the theory-practice gap discourse.","[Fossum, Knut R.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Fossum, Knut R.] NTNU Samfunnsforskning AS, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Space, Trondheim, Norway; [Binder, Jean C.] Univ Fribourg, Int Inst Management Technol, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Madsen, Tage K.] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Mkt & Management, Kolding, Denmark; [Aarseth, Wenche] Nord Univ, Business Sch, Bodo, Norway; [Andersen, Bjorn] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, IPK, Trondheim, Norway","Fossum, KR (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn, Trondheim, Norway.; Fossum, KR (corresponding author), NTNU Samfunnsforskning AS, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Space, Trondheim, Norway.",Knut.Fossum@ciris.no,"; Fossum, Knut Robert/P-1508-2018","Binder, Jean/0000-0002-6098-0958; Madsen, Tage Koed/0000-0002-0093-5100; Fossum, Knut Robert/0000-0002-1020-730X",,,,87,3,3,1,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

Crashing generally involves allocating extra resources to an activity with the intention of reducing its duration. To date, the activity time-cost relationship has for the most part been assumed to be linear, however, a few studies have suggested that this is not necessarily the case in practice. This paper proposes two non-linear theoretical models which assume either collaborative or non-collaborative resources. These models closely depict the two most common situations occurring during construction projects. The advantages of these models are that they allow for both discrete and continuous, as well as deterministic and stochastic configurations. Additionally, the quantity of resources required for crashing the activity can be quantified. Comparisons between the models and another recent fast-tracking model from the literature are discussed, and a Genetic Algorithm is implemented for a fictitious application example involving both compression techniques.","[Ballesteros-Perez, Pablo] Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Elamrousy, Kamel Mohamed] Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Reading RG6 6DF, Berks, England; [Carmen Gonzalez-Cruz, Ma] Univ Politecn Valencia, GIDDP, Dept Proyectos Ingn, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain","Gonzalez-Cruz, MC (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, GIDDP, Dept Proyectos Ingn, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",p.ballesteros-perez@lboro.ac.uk; elamrousy@aucegypt.edu; mcgonzal@dpi.upv.es,"Ballesteros-Perez, Pablo/I-6002-2015; Gonzalez-Cruz/V-3242-2017","Ballesteros-Perez, Pablo/0000-0002-4629-9664; Gonzalez-Cruz/0000-0002-6987-5732",CIOB Bowen Jenkins Legacy Research Fund [BLJ2016/BJL.01]; NERC under the Environmental Risks to Infrastructure Innovation Programme at the University of Reading [NE/R008876/1],This research was supported by the CIOB Bowen Jenkins Legacy Research Fund (reference BLJ2016/BJL.01) and by NERC under the Environmental Risks to Infrastructure Innovation Programme (reference NE/R008876/1) at the University of Reading.,,64,19,19,4,40,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Previous studies suggest the need to improve contractors' risk management by partnering with project participants and enhancing their organizational capability. Nevertheless, limited research has systematically and quantitatively addressed the causal relationships among them. This study quantifies the relationships among these themes via the development and validation of a conceptual mediation model. With supporting data from Chinese contractors, this research outlines the statuses on contractors' risk management, application of partnering, and their organizational capability. Path analysis validates that partnering not only effectively facilitates risk management via promotion of contractor capability but also directly enhances risk management. Canonical correlation analyses further reveal the different degrees to which partnering critical success factors (CSFs), contractor capability indicators, and risk management processes are associated. The previously mentioned results contribute to both theory and practice by building interdisciplinary linkages among risk management, partnering, and contractor capability in international EPC project delivery. An in-depth understanding of these cause-effect relationships will allow multiorganizational dynamic risk management research to become state-of-the-art, and will aid EPC contractors in appropriately integrating both intraorganizational and interorganizational resources to manage project risks and achieve superior performance in international EPC projects.","[Wang, Tengfei; Tang, Wenzhe; Du, Lei] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Project Management & Construct Technol, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Duffield, Colin F.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Wei, Yongping] Univ Melbourne, Australia China Ctr Water Resources Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Tang, WZ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Inst Project Management & Construct Technol, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",twz@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Duffield, Colin F/E-7522-2015","Duffield, Colin F/0000-0001-6497-7759","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51379104, 51579135, 51079070, 50539130, 70671058]; State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering [2013-KY-5, 2015-KY-5, 2009-ZY-7]","The authors greatly appreciate the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51379104, 51579135, 51079070, 50539130, and 70671058), and State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering (No. 2013-KY-5, 2015-KY-5, 2009-ZY-7).

A total of 24 variables were identified by the literature review and a pilot study. An international questionnaire survey was performed to obtain professional opinions from both practitioners and the academy. The 24 variables were ranked and clustered into 6 factors using exploratory factor analysis. Furthermore, a case study of the Early Train Operator project of the California HSR was carried out by the survey, interview, and first-hand data. The results indicated that the top six ranked variables are (1) None Accident History, (2) Eligibility & International Criteria, (3) Contract Reputation, (4) Marketing Strategy, (5) Risk Management Capability, and (6) Technical Responsiveness. Furthermore, the 24 variables are grouped into six dimensions: Glocalization, Marketing, Safety, Economics, Technology, and Responsibility. The case study indicated that the factor framework was suitable and tractable for the application. The findings of this paper could (1) assist international HSR contractors in obtaining a better understanding of the deeper determinates of competitive advantages and (2) serve as a valuable reference for developing their competitive advantages in the international HSR market.","[Niu, Yanliang; Duan, Xiaochen] Shijiazhuang Tiedao Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Deng, Xiaopeng] Southeast Univ, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Limao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore","Deng, XP (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dxp@seu.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Limao/0000-0002-7245-3741","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [NSFC-71771052, NSFC-61503261, NSFC-71372199]; Key Discipline of Management Science and Engineering of Hebei, China; Key research center of humanities and social sciences of Hebei (Construction Management Center of Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, China); Soft Science Research Center of Hebei, China","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. NSFC-71771052, NSFC-61503261, NSFC-71372199; Key Discipline of Management Science and Engineering of Hebei, China; Key research center of humanities and social sciences of Hebei (that is Construction Management Center of Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, China); and Soft Science Research Center of Hebei, China.",,141,8,8,10,34,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

It is widely recognized that the competition rule should be placed on a win-win basis to ensure that both the client and contractors are well considered with respect to their interests. Nevertheless, a vast majority of biddings fail to take account of what contractors really want. Using the methods of literature review and content analysis, 34 tender evaluation factors are proposed to compose the competition rule in China. Contractors' opinions on these factors are collected by virtue of questionnaire survey. Based on the Pareto law, it is found that the competition rule encompasses eleven key factors, and the composition varies slightly between public and private sectors. The Hotelling's T test is conducted on those key factors in common. The implication is that contractors can use indifferent factors (e.g., credit rating, construction plan, completeness of bid components, timely payment to workers) to improve competitiveness, while the client may utilize different factors to diversify the competition rule. This paper probably presents an earliest effort put to examine the acceptability of competition rule in the construction context.","[Ye, Kunhui] Chongqing Univ, Sch Construct Management & Real Estate, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Dan] Chongqing Univ, Res Ctr Construct Econ & Management, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Wong, Johnny] Univ Technol, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Ye, KH (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Construct Management & Real Estate, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",Kunhui.YE@Gmail.com,,,Chongqing University [106112016 CDJSK 03 XK 08],This work was supported by Chongqing University under Grant No. 106112016 CDJSK 03 XK 08.,,49,6,6,1,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

A dynamic hypothesis was developed through interviews with field experts. Subsequently, a general simulation model of O/C relationships was formulated using system dynamics modeling. The model was quantitatively and qualitatively validated using a real construction project. The model can replicate the general behavior during the evolution of O/C relationships. Several individual policies and their different combinations were explored through extensive simulation to analyze their effects on the dynamics of O/C relationships. In general, policy combinations produced better results than individual policies. A critical policy comparison proved that the combined effect of preconstruction stage policies was more influential on relationships in the construction stage than the combined effect of construction stage policies. The best result was found when both policy combinations were implemented simultaneously. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","[Nasir, Muhammad Kamran; Hadikusumo, Bonaventura H.

This paper investigates supply chain risks in construction projects with respect to life cycle and corresponding stakeholders. The research was organized with two stages. In the first stage, a systematic literature review accompanied by a content analysis was conducted based on risks in construction supply chains (CSCs) to identify research gaps, suggest future research directions, and support subsequent steps. Then, three focus group discussions (FGDs) were performed by industry representatives to (1) specify life cycle risks in CSCs, (2) associate specified risks to related stakeholders, and (3) ensure the role of each stakeholder in CSCs. Results of the content analysis indicate that relationship, communication, and sustainability are the most frequently examined research areas, while innovation and organizational learning, supplier vulnerability, and negotiation are overlooked in the literature. Based on sessions of FGDs, 135 risks were categorized into 10 phases of construction supply chain life cycle (SCLC) as requirement and demand, design, tendering and contracting, manufacturing, logistics, hand over, inventory, installation, winding up, and control and maintenance. Main contractor, subcontractor, supplier, and client were found as the critical decision entities in tendering and contracting, installation, logistics, and requirement and demand phases, respectively.

The inclusion of all affected parties can facilitate the development of patterns, structures and buildings that are sustainable in the social, ecological and economic dimensions. The slow development of a more sustainable building sector often results from the absence of knowledge about possible benefits because of financial constraints or the presence of conflicting interests. Furthermore, in most cases, measures to foster a sustainable building sector do not include all of the relevant stakeholders or are only one-sided. Based on a literature review of stakeholders in the building sector, this paper describes the stakeholders involved in the development of sustainable buildings and the challenges in stakeholder motivation. The practical case of the Network for Sustainable Construction Switzerland demonstrates how to foster sustainable construction by including a wide range of stakeholders and the need to address stakeholders with diverse initiatives. This case study supports the hypothesis that stakeholder motivation cannot be created by a single initiative; rather, a variety of actions are required to deliver change successfully.","[Feige, Annika; Wallbaumand, Holger; Krank, Sabrina] ETH, Inst Construct & Infrastruct Management, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Feige, A (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Construct & Infrastruct Management, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",feige@ibi.baug.ethz.ch; wallbaum@ibi.baug.ethz.ch; kranks@ethz.ch,"Wallbaum, Holger/B-6272-2008","Wallbaum, Holger/0000-0001-5809-9400",Ernst Basler Partner; Holcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction,"This study was supported financially by Ernst Basler & Partner and the Holcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction.

Behavioral psychology posits that human behavior is driven by psychology, and personality is one of the important psychological characteristics affecting human behavior. However, there is a lack of systematic research on the relationship between the personality and unsafe behavior of construction workers. This research explored the preliminary relationship between the personality type and unsafety behavior of construction workers, and analyzed the differences in safety performance from the perspective of personality types. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) was used as the personality evaluation method, and a questionnaire was designed and distributed in a bridge construction project in Jiangsu Province, China. A total of 164 responses were collected, and 129 of them were valid. The results showed that (1) most of construction workers had a preference for extraversion (E) (63.6%), sensing (S) (62.8%), thinking (T) (73.6%), and judging (J) (61.3%); (2) ESTJ (24.8%), ESTP (where P is perceiving) (9.3%), ENTJ (where N is intuition) (9.3%), ISTJ (where I is introversion) (7.8%), and INTJ (7.8%) were the five most diverse personality types, exceeding half of the total number of survey; (3) ESTJ and ESFJ (where F is feeling) types of workers had higher average accident losses (3.6 and 4.0, respectively) than those with the other personality types (less than 2.0); and (4) ESTJ and ESFJ types of construction workers had relatively longer safe periods (3-4 and more than 4.0, respectively) as well. These findings will contribute to the body of knowledge in construction safety management, and help targeted construction worker safety training as well as on-site supervision, thus reducing the possibility of worker injury and improving the safety level on site.","[Ma, Ling; Guo, Hongling] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Fang, Yihai] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 23 Coll Walk, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia","Guo, HL (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",maling901@163.com; hlguo@tsinghua.edu.cn; yihai.fang@monash.edu,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51208282, 51578318]","We appreciate the comments from Prof. Tingsheng Zhao at Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Prof. Dan Zhang at Tsinghua University on this research, and the assistance of China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Group and the Academy of Railway Sciences (Beijing) Engineering Consult in data collection.

To protect construction workers and prevent accidents in such sites, this paper proposes a novel design for an autonomous system that monitors, localizes, and warns site laborers who avail within danger zones. The proposed system is user-friendly, and its architecture is based on Internet of Things (IoT). The heterogeneous components of this architecture are seamlessly integrated into a middleware backend online server. To accurately detect and identify construction workers, the proposed system employs three combined techniques. They are 1) the 868 MHz radio frequency, 2) directional antennas, and 3) the 40 kHz ultrasound waves. Vehicle's rear is secured by a sensing unit that ensures good coverage along with a wearable device for workers. The design of the wearable device includes a set of components which are a radio transceiver (transmitter/receiver), a wake-up sensor, an alarm actuator, and a GPRS module. The wearable device has a power saving scheme with a current consumption as low as 0.5 mu A at 3 V supply; thanks to our RF wake-up sensor. Via proximity, this wearable device becomes hybrid (active/passive) in which it remains in deep sleep mode until the presence of a radio frequency (RF) field. Consequently, the rechargeable battery's life gets increased by up to 2 days of autonomy before recharging. Furthermore, the paper presents an implementation of wireless nodes that are powered by light energy using photovoltaic cells. These nodes adopt energy management and storage schemes for continuous operation for indoor and outdoor environments.","[Kanan, Raid; Elhassan, Obaidallah; Bensalem, Rofaida] Abu Dhabi Univ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Kanan, R (corresponding author), Abu Dhabi Univ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",riadkanan@gmail.com,,"Kanan, Riad/0000-0001-6517-0711",Abu Dhabi University's Office of Research and Sponsored Programs-Research Center in Smart Services for Smart Cities [19300067],The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of Abu Dhabi University's Office of Research and Sponsored Programs-Research Center in Smart Services for Smart Cities [grant number: 19300067].

One technique that can be used to measure worker attention is eye tracking, which is widely accepted as the most direct and continuous measure of attention because where one looks is highly correlated with where one is focusing his or her attention. Thus, with the fundamental objective of measuring the impacts of safety knowledge (specifically, training, work experience, and injury exposure) on construction workers' attentional allocation, this study demonstrates the application of eye tracking to the realm of construction safety practices. To achieve this objective, a laboratory experiment was designed in which participants identified safety hazards presented in 35 construction site images ordered randomly, each of which showed multiple hazards varying in safety risk. During the experiment, the eye movements of 27 construction workers were recorded using a head-mounted EyeLink II system. The impact of worker safety knowledge in terms of training, work experience, and injury exposure (independent variables) on eye-tracking metrics (dependent variables) was then assessed by implementing numerous permutation simulations. The results show that tacit safety knowledge acquired from work experience and injury exposure can significantly improve construction workers' hazard detection and visual search strategies. The results also demonstrate that (1) there is minimal difference, with or without the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 10-h certificate, in workers' search strategies and attentional patterns while exposed to or seeing hazardous situations; (2) relative to less experienced workers (<5 years), more experienced workers (>10 years) need less processing time and deploy more frequent short fixations on hazardous areas to maintain situational awareness of the environment; and (3) injury exposure significantly impacts a worker's visual search strategy and attentional allocation. In sum, practical safety knowledge and judgment on a jobsite requires the interaction of both tacit and explicit knowledge gained through work experience, injury exposure, and interactive safety training. This study significantly contributes to the literature by demonstrating the potential application of eye-tracking technology in studying the attentional allocation of construction workers. Regarding practice, the results of the study show that eye tracking can be used to improve worker training and preparedness, which will yield safer working conditions, detect at-risk workers, and improve the effectiveness of safety-training programs.

The data, collected from 134 participants, were used in various statistical analyses including relative importance index (RII), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), linear regression analysis, and correlation and comparison of means analysis. The results emphasized that having better risk management and sharing designs and technical solutions are the main motivational factors affecting the partnering decision. It was also found that the most significant challenges are in sharing technical expertise with partners and management of partners' relations. The conclusion is that multiple measures should be established by public agencies and project owners to facilitate cooperation between general contractors that will bring benefits to both parties. A precise framework is proposed for future researchers to identify and clarify mutual goals, tactical objectives, procedures, and various aspects of partners' relations.","[Gunduz, Murat] Qatar Univ, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar; [Abdi, Ebrahim A.] Qatar Univ, Coll Engn, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar","Gunduz, M (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar.",mgunduz@qu.edu.qa; ea082784@student.qu.edu.qa,,"Gunduz, Murat/0000-0003-2602-3318",,,,68,11,11,2,29,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Design/methodology/approach Multi-wave safety climate surveys were conducted at four processing plant construction projects in New Zealand. Safety climate was measured with a multi-level measurement instrument, which measured construction workers' perceptions of client's organisational safety response (COSR), principal contractor's organisational safety response (PCOSR), supervisors' safety response (SSR) and co-workers' safety response (CWSR). Findings At the organisational level, the research identifies a general downward change trend in workers' perceptions of COSR and PCOSR. At the group level, no clear or consistent change trend is identified between the level of project completion and workers' perceptions of SSR and CWSR. Research limitations/implications The research suggests that the construction project management should consistently emphasise the importance of safety, even when they are facing production pressure. The research highlights the opportunity to examine the role of supervisors' leadership as an antecedent to the group-level safety climate and the development of workers' safety concerns for their co-workers over time. Originality/value This research provides the starting point for understanding safety climate in the dynamic and constantly changing construction project environments, in which the relative priorities change, adverse events arise and production pressures fluctuate over time.","[Zhang, Rita Peihua; Pirzadeh, Payam; Lingard, Helen] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Nevin, Steve] Fonterra Cooperat Grp Ltd, Clandeboye, New Zealand","Zhang, RP (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",rita.zhang@rmit.edu.au,"Pirzadeh, Payam/AAM-9514-2021","Pirzadeh, Payam/0000-0001-6511-0946; Zhang, Rita Peihua/0000-0001-9907-6491; Lingard, Helen/0000-0003-3645-8390",Fonterra Co-operative Group LimitedFonterra; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP120200440],This research was jointly supported by the Fonterra Co-operative Group Limited and Australian Research Council under Linkage Project Grant (No. LP120200440).,,48,14,14,2,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

The Singapore rail sector is a good case in point; the market is mature, rapidly growing and has a strong pipeline of rail projects scheduled for completion by 2030. Despite the strong historical link between the UK and Singapore, UKTCs have been outnumbered and outperformed in the past decade by their rivals within the Singapore rail sector. This study investigates the competitive strategies that are most significant for UKTCs to improve their competitiveness in the Singapore rail sector. Despite its popularity and generalisability, something is fundamentally missing from Porter's generic typology because it places no emphasis on the entry strategies that are specifically essential for firms that compete overseas. Empirical results obtained from 75 questionnaires and validated in 35 interviews found a combination of Porter's generic typology in addition to entry strategies to be most significant for UKTCs to compete in the Singapore rail sector. The perceived importance of some strategic practices varied significantly between interviewees from different organisation types. Significant correlations were also found between several strategic practices associated with cost leadership and differentiation, while focus and entry strategies appeared to be mutually exclusive. The findings appear to differ from Porter's theoretical proposition that firms should adopt a single strategic approach to gain a competitive advantage and achieve superior performance. Instead, a combination of strategies is feasible and more suitable for the construction industry. A hybrid taxonomic framework that comprises the most significant strategic practices associated with Porter's generic typology in addition to entry strategies is recommended for UKTCs to compete in the Singapore rail sector.","[Sabug, Bon Jovi Ramos] Univ Cambridge, Laing ORourke Ctr Construct Engn & Technol, Dept Engn, Cambridge, England; [Pheng, Low Sui] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, Singapore, Singapore","Pheng, LS (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, Singapore, Singapore.",bdglowsp@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,61,1,1,1,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

Through an empirical study of thirteen BIM implementation cases in Taiwan, this study concludes that the proposed model is appropriate to evaluate project-based benefits for a stakeholder who is not familiar with BIM implementation. The research outcomes and findings of BIM benefits evaluation can assist those in the public and private sectors who have sensed the value of BIM and want to implement BIM technology.

Unfortunately, many damages to underground utilities are happening during the course of construction activities. Therefore, there is a need for a greater understanding of damage causes to better manage risks to underground utilities during construction work. Understanding the root causes will help stakeholders and policymakers make the best possible decisions to reduce future damages. In this study, utility locators' perspectives regarding the damage causes and overall prevention process were collected, analyzed, and compared to excavators' perspectives and responses that were previously reported. Surprisingly, the results suggest that stakeholders' behaviors (i.e., human factor), rather than technology limitations or current policies, significantly contribute to a breakdown of the damage prevention process. Specifically, communication between stakeholders, excavators' behaviors, and locators' working conditions have been identified as crucial factors in the damage prevention process. There are few, if any, empirical studies that have recognized the human factor as a contributing element to utility damages. Thus, the findings will help improve future policy development. In addition, the clear and detailed description of damage causes and prevention processes will help stakeholders understand the contribution of their behaviors to the damage prevention process, which will result in a more reliable and workable process.

The paper firstly provides background to the development of project success since the 1970s. Then, an inductive thematic analysis investigates which factors stakeholders, involved in projects, perceived as key to project success. It provides a better understanding of project success and identifies perceptions by senior management, project core team and project recipient stakeholder groups. The main issue highlighted by the research was that, for some groups, there were no common success factors. This suggests a lack of agreement in perceptions of project success factors between these three groups, highlighting discontinuity between them and provides a case for empirical research into multiple stakeholder groups' perceptions of project success. The approach selected employed a combination of a systematic integrative literature review, coding framework and thematic analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

The intent is to identify the key factors relevant to enhancing the supplier's non-contractual relationships with designers. The results reveal the supplier's activeness and technical capability as antecedents to trust, and supplier's technical capability and supplier designer cooperation beyond project boundaries as antecedents to commitment.

A qualitative content analysis was adopted to analyze 149 journal papers. The results indicated an increased interest in exploring OSM stakeholders' issues since 2007. In addition, prior studies focused on the two research themes of stakeholder perceptions and behaviors and stakeholder management. Eleven specific research topics were identified within the two themes, with perceived drivers of and barriers to OSM adoption being the most popular. A research framework was also proposed for systemically articulating developments and gaps for OSM stakeholders.

Although previous studies have suggested that such improper risk allocation may harm the relationship between the owner and the contractor and thus lower project performance, few have explicitly investigated the effects of risk allocation on the contractor's cooperative behavior. This paper fills this gap by empirically exploring whether, how, and when risk allocation influences the contractor's cooperative behavior. To do this, data were collected from 284 Chinese project professionals and hierarchical regression analysis was performed. The results show that pro-owner contractual terms with regard to risk allocation negatively affect the contractor's cooperative behavior, and the contractor's fairness perception partially mediates such an effect. Moreover, risk premium weakens the effect of environmental risks allocation on the contractor's fairness perception, and term specificity strengthens the effect of the contractor's fairness perception on the contractor's cooperative behavior. Theoretically, these insights extend risk allocation studies by identifying the underlying mechanism behind the relationship of risk allocation and interfirm cooperation and thus contribute to sound contractual governance. Practically, this study's findings can help project owners design better contracts, particularly by bearing in mind that risk premium should not always be used to restore the contractor's fairness perception to elicit the contractor's cooperative behavior because it does little to help when owner risks are allocated to contractors.

However, little is known of the factors that may determine the flow of international infrastructure investment to those countries. This study aims to bridge that knowledge gap, first by identifying the determinants of international infrastructure investment, and then by developing a structural equation model to reveal their underlying interrelationships. The structural equation model is applied to country-level data regarding international infrastructure investment with Chinese contractors in 141 countries worldwide over the 9-year period from 2009 to 2017. The results show that three determinants, namely infrastructure quality, labor supply, and investment interdependency, have a positive relationship with a country's international infrastructure investment inflow. However, another determinant, institutional environment, has a significantly negative impact, which suggests that when making foreign infrastructure investment, Chinese contractors enter countries with a comparatively poor institutional environment with substantial political risks. The results also highlight how much a robust infrastructure development plan can help developing countries avoid the poor-infrastructure trap, a situation in which poor infrastructure quality discourages international infrastructure investment. These research findings may assist international infrastructure investment firms to make informed decisions with regard to financing and managing projects and help policymakers who focus on attracting foreign investment in infrastructure.","[Wang, Yunhong; Tang, Wenzhe; Qiang, Maoshan] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Project Management & Construct Technol, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, New Hydraul Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yunhong; Lee, Hyun Woo] Univ Washington, Dept Construct Management, 120 Architecture Hall,Campus Box 351610, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Whittington, Jan] Univ Washington, Dept Urban Design & Planning, 410 Gould Hall,Campus Box 355740, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Tang, WZ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Inst Project Management & Construct Technol, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, New Hydraul Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",twz@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Lee, Hyun Woo/0000-0003-1994-2850","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51579135, 51779124, 51379104, 51079070]; State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering [2013-KY-5, 2015-KY-5]; Major Science and Technology Research Project of Power China [DJ-ZDZX-2015-01-02, DJ-ZDZX-2015-01-07]","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51579135, 51779124, 51379104, and 51079070), State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering (Grant Nos. 2013-KY-5 and 2015-KY-5), and Major Science and Technology Research Project of Power China (Grant Nos.

But little is known about what causes it. This study examines how the mediated power of an owner influences contractor opportunism from the risk perception perspective. Using data from 156 responses to an opinion questionnaire survey, the moderating effect of solidarity on the relationship between mediated power and risk perceptions in the owner contractor relationship is explored. The data were analyzed with Partial-Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results show that the relational risk perceptions and the performance risk perceptions of contractors have a positive influence on their tendency to become opportunist; while the mediated power of the owner can increase the contractor's negative perceptions of relational risks but not performance risks. High solidarity helps to weaken the positive influence of mediated power on the contractor's relational risk perceptions. These findings confirm that risk perception is an important perspective to understand why contractors behave opportunistically. In addressing this situation, owners should put themselves in the contractor's shoes to perceive what kinds of risks the contractor would face, and consider the potential impact of their own behavior to the contractor.

Many applications can benefit from the modeling, simulation, and interpretation capabilities in the new modeling environment that supports improved understanding of system behavior through simulations to evaluate the ability of a particular modality to detect defects. While numerous modeling packages exist to simulate different wave-based modalities, the integrated sensor and media modeling environment is developed to, in a straightforward manner, physically represent the complex subsurface civil infrastructure environment.

This paper presents a multiobjective optimization model that is capable of generating optimal trade-offs between the two conflicting objectives of maximizing the SQOL for single-family housing residents and minimizing the LCC of single-family housing units. The model is designed to maximize the SQOL for housing residents by improving their thermal comfort, indoor lighting quality, indoor air quality, and neighborhood quality. The model is also designed to minimize the LCC of housing units by minimizing the initial housing unit cost as well as its annual energy, utility, and maintenance costs. The model is developed in three main stages that focus on (1)identifying relevant criteria and metrics to measure the performance of these two optimization objectives; (2)modeling all decision variables, objective functions, and constraints; and (3)implementing a multiobjective genetic algorithm model to evaluate its performance.

Recent development points to the need for implementing capital budgeting in construction organizations due to the capital-intensive nature of construction business. The aim here is to investigate the trends in the practice of capital budget evaluation among construction contractors operating in Hong Kong over a 20-year period. A longitudinal survey approach is used; four cross-sectional surveys were conducted between 1994 and 2014. The findings indicate that formal financial evaluation' is the most common technique used for capital budget evaluation. In addition, the practice of capital budget evaluation is more pronounced in the large-sized firms. A comparative analysis of the results of the four surveys reveals that there are variations in the degree and frequency of use of capital budget evaluation techniques over the study period. Further research is needed to understand the challenges associated with the use of sophisticated capital budget evaluation techniques in the construction industry of Hong Kong.","[Lam, Ka Chi; Oshodi, Olalekan Shamsideen] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Lam, KC (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bckclam@cityu.edu.hk,,"LAM, Ka Chi/0000-0002-4573-6631; OSHODI, Olalekan/0000-0001-6106-7717",,,,34,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

The potential of the system was explored and two organizations in the Australian construction industry were used. Qualitative data from in-depth interviews of safety managers and workers involved in system implementation and quantitative data such as incident reports and video usage were analysed. Managers perceived the CodeSafe system to be beneficial and well received by workers. In one organization, the introduction of the CodeSafe system coincided with a reduction in injury rates. However, causal inferences about the impact of the system cannot be made. Workers involved in making the films believed films would be an effective communication tool. However, barriers to implementation of the technology include workers' reluctance to use personal smart phones, limited internet connectivity, and organizational and national regulations on mobile phone use on construction sites.","[Edirisinghe, Ruwini; Lingard, Helen] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Edirisinghe, R (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",ruwini.edirisinghe@rmit.edu.au,,"Lingard, Helen/0000-0003-3645-8390","Department of State Development, Business Innovation [DSDBI-IVP BRD 114]","This work was supported by the Department of State Development, Business & Innovation [DSDBI-IVP BRD 114].",,27,9,9,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Implementation of BIM models in the construction phase, which typically involves participants from different fields, often has numerous BIM-related interfaces and problems. Therefore, feedback from the most recent as-built model tracking and BIM model problems are essential for BIM process management (BIM PM) in the construction field. BIM PM has become the most important aspect of a sound as-built BIM model management strategy. Changes in as-built BIM models should be identified, updated, and tracked for BIM PM, such that version management of as-built BIM models can be improved, while minimizing rework and reducing as-built BIM models development duration. Systematic approaches and information on management platforms for enhancing BIM PM during the construction phase are lacking. This study proposes a novel approach to the BIM model management which is to manage and track all versions of as-built BIM models. The primary purpose of this study is to develop a web Construction BIM-based PM (ConBIM-PM) system to enhance a General Contractor's ability to share BIM PM information and track construction projects more efficiently. The ConBIM-PM system provides users with a centralized storage of all versions of as-built models during the construction phase of a project so that they are able to track and manage the current status of modified as-built models and BIM PM information effectively. Finally, the ConBIM-PM system is applied to a case study of a building project in Taiwan to verify its efficacy and demonstrate its effectiveness. The case study results show that the ConBIM-PM system is effective for BIM PM work by a GC during the construction phase of the BIM implementation.","[Lin, Yu-Cheng] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, 229,1 Chung Hsiao E Rd,Sec 3, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Lee, Hsin-Yun] Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1,Sect 1,Shennong Rd, I Lan City, Taiwan; [Yang, I-Tung] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Engn, 43,Sect 4,Keelung Rd, Taipei, Taiwan","Lin, YC (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, 229,1 Chung Hsiao E Rd,Sec 3, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",yclin@ntut.edu.tw,,,"National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","The authors would like to acknowledge the National Science Council, Taiwan, for financially supporting this work and express our appreciation to the D-W-Construction Inc for assistance in the system design and interviews, and to the experts and engineers of the owner of the project for providing useful data, valuable information, and helpful comments during the system design and development.",,44,18,18,4,54,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

At the same time, enhancing the satisfaction of participants not only helps in problem solving but also improves their motivation and cooperation. However, previous research related to participant satisfaction is primarily concerned with clients and customers and relatively little attention has been paid to contractors. This paper investigates how the performance of project participants affects contractor project satisfaction in terms of the client's clarity of objectives (OC) and promptness of payments (PP), designer carefulness (DC), construction risk management (RM), the effectiveness of their contribution (EW) and mutual respect and trust (RT). With 125 valid responses from contractors in Malaysia, a contractor satisfaction model is developed based on structural equation modelling. The results demonstrate the necessity for dividing abstract satisfaction into two dimensions, comprising economic-related satisfaction (ES) and production-related satisfaction (PS), with DC, OC, PP and RM having significant effects on ES, while DC, OC, EW and RM influence PS. In addition, the model tests the indirect effects of these performance variables on ES and PS. In particular, OC indirectly affects ES and PS through mediation of RM and DC respectively. The results also provide opportunities for improving contractor satisfaction and supplementing the contractor selection criteria for clients. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Attempts to reduce downtime often result in failure due to the dynamic behaviors between equipment management practices and downtime. This paper is thus intended to highlight the dynamics of heavy equipment management practices and downtime in large highway contractors and utilizes them as a framework in constructing a simulation model using a system dynamics approach. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with equipment managers from five different large highway contractors in Thailand. The finding reveals that, to be successful in alleviating downtime, contractors must view their practices on equipment management as an integration of multiple feedback processes, which are interrelated and interdependent with downtime. Based on various validation tests, the simulation model is deemed appropriate in representing the equipment management system as related to downtime of large highway contractors. The research is of value in facilitating better understanding on the dynamics of equipment management practices and downtime as well as their interdependency.","[Prasertrungruang, Thanapun; Hadikusumo, B.

However, as performance is an important dimension for prequalifying and selecting ECs, it would be helpful if relevant data can be solicited from various clients. The diversity in the Consultant Performance Evaluation (CPE) criteria and the interpretation of performance levels amongst various assessors would undoubtedly undermine the reliability and transparency of CPE. In this paper, a fuzzy gap analysis model is proposed to improve the practice of CPE. The study begins by identifying a list of CPE criteria and their corresponding quantitative indicators for the design stage of a project. Considering the performance levels for each of the quantitative indicators could be interpreted by assessors differently, an empirical survey is conducted to identify a range of possible values within each of the 'poor', 'average', 'good', 'very good' and 'excellent' performance levels. The fuzzy gap analysis CPE model is proposed to facilitate assessors to compare the client's expectation and actual service quality of an EC. The model proposed in this paper is not only novel but could also improve the fairness and transparency of this type of decision under an increasingly collaborative environment.

Few however, have acknowledged that project environment strategy adoption is a matter of organisational culture (OC). This paper reports a study that aims to examine the effect of some key drivers on the contractors' adoption of carbon reduction strategies in OC perspective. A conceptual model which depicts the hypothesised relationship among OC, carbon reduction drivers and strategy adoption is presented. The model is tested with data collected by a survey conducted in New South Wales, Australia. To test the conceptual model, Pearson correlation analysis and multiple moderated regression (MMR) analysis were employed. The results suggest that the respondents may not adjust their attitudes in carbon reduction strategy adoption for the sake of avoiding 'penalty'. The findings may be thought provoking for those who believe that levies on carbon emissions would lead to a behavioural drift. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

This study finds that the efficiency of Hong Kong contractors is associated with their managerial capability to control business costs and financial capability to manage both short-term and long-term capital liquidity. The efficiency of Mainland China contractors is also associated with their managerial capability to control business and administrative costs but not with their financial capability to maintain capital liquidity. Theoretically, this study shows that managerial and technological abilities are two common factors that transcend different institutions and systems. Hong Kong is the freest economy in the world, whereas the economy of Mainland China is more regulated. Methodologically, data envelopment analysis is adopted to establish the efficiency scores of contractors to be analyzed by panel data regression, which controls individual contractor's return to scale. Few construction competitiveness studies have attempted this methodological process, which can be replicated for future research in other countries, at different stages of their economic development, to ensure equally useful measures for cross-country comparison and to promote the sustainable developments of their construction industries.","[Li, Jing; Chiang, Yat Hung; Choi, Tracy N.

This evaluation process includes a financial analysis and a review of work on hand and past performance, all of which have reliable structured methods for their evaluation. Additionally, a number of subjective criteria are considered that are more difficult to capture and assess objectively but which can be modeled effectively using fuzzy logic. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how fuzzy logic and expert systems can be combined to provide a structured approach to evaluating contractors for surety underwriting purposes. Fuzzy logic is used to model both the objective and subjective factors considered in contractor evaluation using linguistic terms, and expert rules are used to capture the surety experts' reasoning process. A fuzzy expert system, SuretyAssist, is presented that can be used to provide an initial evaluation of general contractors as well as periodic reviews to determine whether or not to accept them as clients for bonding. SuretyAssist was validated using 31 actual cases of contractor evaluation and found to be accurate in 81% of the cases.","[Fayek, Aminah Robinson] Univ Alberta, Hole Sch Construct Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Markin CNRL Nat Resources Engn Facil 3 013, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Marsh, Krista] Univ Alberta, Hole Sch Construct Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Markin CNRL Nat Resources Engn Facil 3 133, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Fayek, AR (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Hole Sch Construct Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Markin CNRL Nat Resources Engn Facil 3 013, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",kdmarsh@ualberta.ca; aminah.robinson@ualberta.ca,"Fayek, Aminah Robinson/AAA-2461-2019","Fayek, Aminah Robinson/0000-0002-3744-273X",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"The writers would like to acknowledge Mr. Andre Giasson, Mr. Jason Smith, and Mr. Brian Davidson of AON Reed Stenhouse, and Mr. Bob Landy, and Ms. Betty Shellnutt of AXA Pacific for their time and expertise in providing input while conducting this research.

Establishing partnerships is among the most effective vehicles of operating in international markets. The major objective of this paper is to analyze the partnership behavior of contractors in overseas projects. In this respect, social network analysis (SNA) was used to better understand the collaborative project networks in different markets and for projects of differing sizes. A database was developed based on the collaborative international construction projects where Turkish firms and their non-Turkish partners were involved. A total of 449 projects carried out in 46 countries were used for the analysis. The findings of the study suggest that contractors adopt different strategies depending on the market and project characteristics. The majority of the companies tend to remain in the same markets; they keep working with the same partners or choose local partners; and engage with multiple partners in more complex projects. This study is expected to help contractors reflect on their internationalization decisions and devise appropriate strategies to establish project networks.","[Akgul, Bartug Kemal; Dikmen, Irem; Birgonul, M.

Apart from specialised and highly technical projects, foreign players are also increasingly gaining various types of projects in Malaysia. The gradual increase in foreign investors' market share over the last few years indicate the need to enhance the capabilities of local players to remain competitive. Competitiveness frameworks formulated at the nation or industry level in previous studies were mainly focused on the macro level with limited studies measuring the contractor's competitiveness at the firm level. Therefore, the development of a competitiveness framework at the firm or micro-level for local contractors in the Malaysian construction industry is required. This paper aims to appraise the competitiveness of local contractors towards globalisation and liberalisation in Malaysia. The objective of this paper is to develop a competitiveness framework for local contractors towards globalisation and liberalisation. This framework consists of five variables namely, competitiveness awareness of local contractors, factors contributing to the competitiveness of local contractors, drivers of competitiveness among local contractors, challenges among local contractors in the Malaysian construction industry in competing with local and foreign contractors and competitive strategies of local contractors in competing with local and foreign contractors. The partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to develop the competitiveness framework consisting of five variables. Four variables namely, competitiveness awareness, competitiveness factors, drivers of competitiveness and competitive strategy shared a direct relationship. Meanwhile, challenges of competitiveness reported an indirect relationship with competitive strategy. This paper addresses the Internationalisation Thrust under CITP 2016-2020 to increase the competitiveness of the domestic market. The competitiveness framework developed in this paper serves as a guideline for local contractors in raising their competitive advantage amid the challenges of globalisation and liberalisation.","[Ab Rani, Nur Izzati; Mat Isa, Che Maznah] Univ Teknol MARA, Civil Engn Fac, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ismail, Syuhaida; Mohamed, Zainai] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Razak Fac Technol & Informat, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Ab Rani, NI (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA, Civil Engn Fac, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia.",izzati.rani@uitm.edu.my,"Ismail, Syuhaida/K-6892-2019",,,,,66,0,0,3,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

However, there are a limited number of studies investigating the relationship between business level strategy and implementation of PM in the construction industry. This paper aligns one of the business strategies, namely differentiation, with the PM process. A framework representing differentiation in the construction industry is proposed in this study. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is used to validate the relationship between differentiation and the PM process. The results show that a relationship between differentiation strategy and PM exists. The two types of differentiation are revealed, namely product variety and speed-related differentiation (PSD) and quality and image-related differentiation (QID). The companies trying to differentiate based on PSD should focus on cost, time and quality management. Change management and project planning are identified as important drivers of differentiation based on PSD. On the other hand, the companies trying to differentiate on QID should consider health, safety and environmental issues as well as quality. Companies should also manage their resources effectively to support the PM process that in turn leads to successful differentiation. Companies can utilize the research findings as a guideline while formulating their differentiation strategies.","[Budayan, Cenk] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34220 Istanbul, Turkey; [Budayan, Cenk] Univ Salford, Sch Built Environm, Salford, Lancs, England; [Dikmen, Irem; Birgonul, M.

Parallel to the well-known critical path method, linear scheduling techniques have been researched. The two most fully developed existing methods, the linear scheduling model and the repetitive scheduling method, are reviewed. Based on a discussion of a published example, the new mathematical analysis method for linear and repetitive schedules is introduced. The productivity scheduling method is based on singularity functions that provide a flexible and powerful mathematical model for construction activities and their buffers that are characterized by their linear or repetitive nature. The steps of formulating initial equations, stacking and consolidating them, and deriving information about their criticality are described in detail. The mathematical approach of the new method allows an integrated treatment of activities regardless of the number of changes in productivity within them and does not depend on the graphical representation of the schedule.","Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Civil Engn, Washington, DC 20064 USA","Lucko, G (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Civil Engn, Washington, DC 20064 USA.",lucko@cua.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI-0654318],"The support of the National Science Foundation (Grant No. CMMI-0654318) for portions of the work presented here is gratefully acknowledged.

A theoretical framework of stakeholder strategic actions was proposed and applied, and a multiple-case study in the Vietnamese construction industry was employed. Three combinations of influence strategies were identified: communication and credibility building were employed concurrently by organised groups in projects affecting the environment; direct action and conflict escalation were exerted together by unorganised groups in cases leading to displacements of the locals; and coalition building was combined with communication by both groups irrespective of projects' impacts. The utilisation of a combination can be affected by the selection of lobbying actions and characteristics of individual strategies, and stakeholders' motives, attributes and perceptions.

Findings Both formal and informal HGs exert positive effects on the performance of mega-projects. While formal HG positively affects contractor perfunctory behavior and contractor consummate behavior, informal HG affects contractor perfunctory behavior only. Contractor behavior mediates the relationship between formal HG and project performance. Research limitations/implications The impacts of potential moderators (e.g. institutional arrangement and complexity) on the relationship between HG and contractor behavior have not been considered in this study. Practical implications This study is useful for owners to enhance formal HG to improve contractor perfunctory and consummate behaviors, which in turn can enhance the performance of mega-projects.

The financial ratios of the construction contractors in the United States were collected, and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and Tomek links were employed to obtain a balanced data set. The proposed LSTM RNN model was evaluated by comparing its accuracy and F1-score with feedforward neural network (FNN) and support vector machine (SVM) models for the optimized parameters selected from a grid search with five-fold cross-validation. The results successfully demonstrate that the prediction performance of the proposed LSTM RNN model outperforms FNN and SVM models for both test and original data set.

The framework's usability is preliminary evaluated through a case study of a multi-stakeholder implementation of an electronic health record (ERR) system in an institutionalized hospital environment. The framework enables a coherent assessment of stakeholders' issues.

To address this issue, this paper develops a novel ELECTRE III-based MCGDM approach for bid evaluation, in which generalized comparative linguistic expressions (GCLEs) are used to evaluate bidder performance. The collected GCLEs are further transformed into possibility-distributionbased hesitant fuzzy linguistic-term sets (HFLTSs) to facilitate the qualitative construction of individual expertise. A consensus-reaching process is introduced to promote decisions that are agreed upon by experts and thereby ensure an enhanced state of mutual agreement among the experts. Subsequently, an integrated subjective-objective approach is proposed to calculate criterion weights and to implement an ELECTRE III-based method that incorporates HFLTS possibility distributions, which allows us to treat the indetermination, imprecision, and uncertainty embedded in appraisals of alternative-criterion decisions when evaluating bids. The potential advantages of the proposed approach are validated by a real-life contractor-selection case.","[Chen, Zhen-Song; Zhang, Xuan] Wuhan Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Rodriguez, Rosa M.; Martinez, Luis] Univ Jaen, Dept Comp Sci, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Pedrycz, Witold] Univ Alberta, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Chen, ZS (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",zschen@whu.edu.cn; xuanzhang@whu.edu.cn; rmrodrig@ujaen.es; wpedrycz@ualberta.ca; martin@ujaen.es,"Chen, Zhen-Song/K-3436-2019; Martinez, Luis/A-1746-2009; Rodriguez, Rosa M./B-9618-2011","Chen, Zhen-Song/0000-0003-4360-5459; Martinez, Luis/0000-0003-4245-8813; Rodriguez, Rosa M./0000-0002-1736-8915","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71801175, 71871171, 71971182, 72031009]; Themebased Research Projects of the Research Grants Council [T32101/15R]; Spanish Government ProjectSpanish Government [PGC2018099402BI00]; City University of Hong Kong SRGCity University of Hong Kong [7004969];  [RyC201721978]","The authors would like to thank the editors and the two anonymous referees for their prompt, thorough, and insightful comments on this paper.

This study's purpose was to investigate the satisfaction levels of clients within contractors' services in reconstruction programs. Client satisfaction can determine the ability of a contractor to meet the client values. Opportunities can be found for improving reconstruction programs by providing awareness of how construction service providers perform in postdisaster situations. However, little time and attention have been invested in understanding the client values and satisfaction within contracting services in the rebuild environment after a disaster. The study included a literature review to identify the significance of understanding client values and satisfaction within contracting services for postdisaster reconstruction projects. Using a questionnaire survey with public and private clients, the research determined the levels of importance and performance of the client values. Satisfaction analysis, priority ranking, and importance-performance analysis were applied to identify and prioritize the critical values. The findings reveal the critical values as areas of concern for preplanning and rethinking to improve the services provided in the disaster rebuild environment.

The involvement of a multinational design team increases design-related issues for contractors, which must be managed during the construction stage. Thus, contractors need to understand how appropriate design management can positively affect project performance and their profit. Identification of critical design management factors (CDMFs) can provide appropriate decision-making support for contractors, including how limited resources including money, manpower, and equipment can be allocated throughout the construction stage. This study identifies and ranks the CDMFs for HRPs designed by multinational design teams. Through a questionnaire survey in South Korea, 21 design management factors were acknowledged among 40 initial factors. Then, using factor analysis, these 21 identified CDMFs were categorized into four groups: interface management, design information, production stage, and risk contribution. Based on results, this study identifies general and regional features of design management. Because these CDMFs are chosen from the contractor's perspective, if they are used to make appropriate decisions, the overall project performance should be increased during the construction phases.

In this paper, a questionnaire based on a sample of contractors was employed to explore the effect of contract completeness on contractors' opportunistic behavior, as well as the moderating role of interdependence. The results show that term specificity, contingency adaptability, and contractual obligatoriness all have negative effects on contractors' opportunistic behavior (both weak and strong forms), while issue inclusiveness positively influences contractors' opportunistic behavior. In addition, except for the positive moderating role of interdependence magnitude on the relationship between contingency adaptability and contractors' opportunistic behavior (weak form), the other three significant moderating effects (magnitude on issue inclusiveness and strong form, magnitude on contractual obligatoriness and strong form, asymmetry on term specificity and strong form) are all found to be negative. These findings can give insight into the many ways that contracts affect opportunism, and thus help both sides strategically react to opportunistic disturbances and minimize transaction costs.

Public engagement (PE) has emerged as a prerequisite for collecting stakeholders' opinions and involving them in the planning and decision making of construction development projects. It is not easy to identify and manage stakeholders in PE because different stakeholders possess different types of power and interests that have the potential to dramatically affect stakeholder behaviors and final project outcomes. However, the effects of stakeholder attributes (i.e.,power and interest) on stakeholder management in PE and final PE outcomes have been insufficiently studied. This study aimed to investigate the complicated relationships between stakeholders' power, interests, and PE outcomes through a questionnaire survey. An integrated model for stakeholder power, interest, and PE outcomes was developed using a structural equation model. The results showed that different forms of power and interest influenced final PE outcomes either directly or indirectly. PE organizers are encouraged to directly involve project teams, experts, and reputable stakeholders in the PE process and allow the media and nongovernmental organizations to monitor the decision-making process. The findings of this study will contribute to stakeholder management for PE in construction projects by developing a structural model that can be adopted to identify stakeholder power and interests and engage appropriate stakeholders in the decision-making process. It is expected to improve PE outcomes and enhance stakeholder satisfaction for construction development projects.","[Yu, Jingyu] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Tunxi Rd, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Leung, Mei-yung] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Yu, JY (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Tunxi Rd, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China.",yujingyu@hfut.edu.cn,"Leung, Mei-yung/K-4075-2015","Leung, Mei-yung/0000-0003-4186-2347",Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors (Planning and Development Division) [NP022075-02],"The work described in this paper was fully supported by a grant from the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors (Planning and Development Division, Project No. NP022075-02).",,67,8,8,3,45,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

While businesses are increasing their expenditure on technology to keep abreast of competitors, organisations in the construction industry have become 'technological laggards'. Both the Federal and State Governments in Australia have recognized the pivotal role that IT can play in improving industry performance and consequently firms are being, encouraged to embrace IT. In obtaining performance improvements, the benefits, costs and risks of IT should be identified and subsequently managed and controlled. Yet, there is an absence of anchor measures that managers can confidently employ to monitor the performance of their IT investments. This paper presents findings from a questionnaire survey that sought to determine the benefits, costs and risks of IT investments from 126 small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Australian construction industry. The questionnaire findings revealed three key findings. First, different organisation types significantly differ in the amount they invest in IT but this is not influenced by firm size (i.e., in terms of turnover and number of employees). Secondly, strategic benefits vary with different organisation types. Third, the way in which employees adapt to change as a result of IT implementation differs with firm size. Based upon the reported findings a series of benchmark metrics for benefits, costs and risks of IT were propagated. These metrics can serve as a reference point for initiating benchmarking, which should form an integral component of the IT evaluation and learning process.

The findings show three ICT practices used for managing external stakeholders: visualisation, simulation and social mediatisation. Taking a sociomateriality lens we demonstrate how these practices are used for diverse unintended uses to manage external stakeholders. Anchored in a dimensions of power framework, we discuss how these ICT practices were strategically used for persuading, framing and hegemonizing external stakeholders in megaprojects. Theoretically, we highlight the role of ICT for managing external stakeholders over the current use of improving the competitive advantage of internal stakeholders.

This is because construction SM has attained poor industrial feat in the past decades. Hitherto, there is lack of an elaborative tool to manage SM performance in construction projects. Hence, this review fills the gap by presenting a conceptual model of SM performance attributes comprising performance objectives (POs), success factors (SFs) and performance indicators (PIs) that could be engaged to manage (i.e. benchmark, enhance, monitor, and measure) the performance of construction SM. The outcome will benefit professionals and researchers due to the flexibility of selecting a number of attributes that fit the nature, type and stage of projects in order to ensure effective management. It therefore provides a better means of measuring project success in the industry by objectively and subjectively evaluating the level of stakeholder and organisational satisfaction in construction project delivery.

Design/methodology/approach This study developed three LSTM-RNN-based models that predicted the probability of bankruptcy before 1, 2 and 3 years using financial, the construction market and macroeconomic variables as input variables. Then, the impacts of the input variables that affected prediction accuracy in each model were identified by using Shapley value and compared among the three models. This study also investigated the prediction accuracy using variants of input variables grouped sequentially by high-impact ranking. Findings The results showed that the prediction accuracies were largely impacted by housing starts in all models. As the prediction period increased, the effects of macroeconomic variables on prediction accuracy increased, whereas the impact of return on assets on prediction accuracy decreased. It also found that the current ratio and debt ratio significantly influenced the prediction accuracies in all models. Also, the results revealed that similar prediction accuracies could be achieved using only 8, 10, and 10 variables out of a total of 18 variables for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction models, respectively. Originality/value This study provides a Shapley value-based approach to identify how each input variable in a deep-learning bankruptcy prediction model. The findings of this study can not only assist in obtaining better insights into the underlying concept of bankruptcy but also use to select variables by removing those identified as less significant.","[Jang, Youjin] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Construct Management & Engn, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Jeong, Inbae] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Cho, Yong K.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Jang, YJ (corresponding author), North Dakota State Univ, Dept Construct Management & Engn, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",y.jang@ndsu.edu; inbae.jeong@ndsu.edu; yong.cho@ce.gatech.edu,"Jeong, Inbae/AAN-6730-2021","Jeong, Inbae/0000-0002-8316-1445",,,,39,0,0,5,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

They stem from risks that have unfortunately been realized in a project and how they will be pursued is up to company strategy, operational particularities and managers' skills and experience. Claims, in general, have an adverse effect on a project's supply chain by compromising actors' relationships, project implementation and project outcomes. It is imperative that all contractors follow a well-designed claims management strategy that is guided by well-defined and accurately documented operational processes outlined in detail. Process models related to claims management are scarcely found in the literature. These models are evaluated and a new process reference model, that attempts to improve the claims management process and rectify the identified shortcomings of existing models, such as a lack of transactions between the contractor and other supply chain actors, is proposed. In doing so, a number of process models are created. The objective of this paper is to prescribe the claims management process as an integral process to the supply chain of a construction project in an effort to raise awareness of this relationship and provide a holistic view to claims management through a supply chain management lens.","[Stamatiou, Dimitrios Robert, I; Ponis, Stavros T.; Gayialis, Sotiris; Tatsiopoulos, Ilias] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Athens, Greece; [Kirytopoulos, Konstantinos A.] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Stamatiou, DRI (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Athens, Greece.",drstam@mail.ntua.gr,"Gayialis, Sotiris/AAE-2814-2019; PONIS, STAVROS/AAC-9945-2019","Gayialis, Sotiris/0000-0002-7524-0215; PONIS, STAVROS/0000-0002-9544-9219; Stamatiou, Dimitrios-Robert/0000-0002-9443-6037",European Union (European Social Fund - ESF)European Social Fund (ESF); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) - Research Funding Program: THALES - Investing in knowledge society through the European Social Fund,The authors wish to acknowledge that part of this research has been funded by the European Union (European Social Fund - ESF) and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) - Research Funding Program: THALES - Investing in knowledge society through the European Social Fund.

This study aims to identify, categorize and prioritize the critical success factors for health care construction projects in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. An extensive literature review was carried out to identify the success factors for health care construction projects. The analytical hierarchical process was then applied to prioritize the main criteria and sub-criteria of health care construction project success factors. This study consists of 10 main criteria and 36 sub-criteria relevant to health care construction projects. The respondents of this study consist of two main groups: customers and contractors. The customers were selected from one of the leading governmental hospitals in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the contractors are from a major contracting company operating within the health care industry. From each respondent group, leadership positions were selected from relevant departments, including finance, operations, marketing, engineering and supply chain management. The findings of the study show that the leading critical success factor groups are financial capability and management. Moreover, top management support, adequate funding, availability of resources and effective strategic planning were found to be top factors affecting project success. Differences in priorities were observed between customer and contractor perspectives based on the different roles of each stakeholder. To highlight, customers ranked management and financial capability as the two most important factors, respectively. However, contractor respondents indicated financial capability as most important, followed by management and strategy factors, which scored as equally important. As results shown in this study are obtained from only customers and contractors, future studies could include consultants and regulatory authorities, along with considering more success factors.","[Al Kuwaiti, Eisa; Ajmal, Mian M.; Hussain, Matloub] Abu Dhabi Univ, Coll Business Adm, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Ajmal, MM (corresponding author), Abu Dhabi Univ, Coll Business Adm, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",mian.ajmal@adu.ac.ae,"Ajmal, Mian M./Q-8919-2019","Ajmal, Mian M./0000-0001-9534-7629",,,,58,7,7,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

Quantitative evaluations are introduced to set the likely chance of a claim occurrence, to manage the claim success and to expect a negotiation offer ratio for the profit in claim negotiation. The product output of these parameters sets the conditional contractor's decision for the price reduction that may be assigned in the original bid.

First, EHFLTSs are used for the elicitation of hesitant linguistic assessment information of QFD team members. Considering the interrelations between CRs, Choquet integral is applied to obtain the aggregated relationship evaluation results.

The theoretical foundation of the proposed equity analysis is grounded in the area of social welfare theory. The ontology was verified and validated using automated consistency checking, automated redundancy checking, expert evaluation, and real-life case study evaluation. The proposed ontology-based system may support infrastructure system decision-making by assessing the social (group) welfare based on the economic, social, and environmental benefits of transportation project alternatives and taking stakeholder preferences into account, and may lead to better identification of the alternative(s) that offer the highest social welfare.

It is crucial to explore the relative importance and groupings of these factors. This paper aims to identify CSFs associated with stakeholder management in construction projects, and explore their ranking and underlying relationship. 15 CSFs were identified through a literature review, and consolidated by interviews and pilot studies with professionals in construction industry. A questionnaire instrument containing these 15 CSFs was sent out to project managers in Hong Kong, and 183 completed questionnaires were retrieved. The top three ranked factors for stakeholder management were managing stakeholders with social responsibilities, assessing the stakeholders' needs and constraints to the project, and communicating with stakeholders properly and frequently. Using factor analysis and considering the high importance of the factor managing stakeholders with social responsibilities, the 15 CSFs were grouped into five dimensions namely, precondition factor, stakeholder estimation, information inputs, decision making, and sustainable support. All these five groupings and their relationship were included in a framework for successful stakeholder management in construction projects. These findings help to clarify what the high prioritized factors are, and could also be used as an assessment tool to evaluate the performance of stakeholder management and thus help to identify areas for improvement.","[Yang, Jing; Shen, Geoffrey Qiping; Ho, Manfong; Drew, Derek S.; Chan, Albert P.

Past research has sporadically investigated adverse situations affecting stakeholder engagement but lacks a thorough empirical investigation. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach A web survey was designed to address the knowledge gap of the identification of the impactful adverse situations during multi-stakeholder engagement. The research yielded 144 completed responses from multi-stakeholders engaged in globally distributed ICT projects. Findings Exploratory factor analysis revealed eight factors that underpin 26 adverse situations. The top factors, ranked in terms of importance according to their Relative Importance Index (RII) are: dysfunctional conflicts, dearth of reasoning, glitches in project governance, clash of personalities. Research limitations/implications This research reveals the factors that can impact engagement in the form of meaningful clusters and dimensions and opens-up a future research agenda toward causation and mitigation studies related to adversarial stakeholder engagement. The study focuses on globally distributed ICT projects and has not explored generalizability in other sectors. Practical implications This research enables project managers and stakeholder analysts to get an understanding on the importance of different dimensions of adverse situations in the way stakeholders think, act and emote. Social implications Awareness on the potential adversarial stakeholder engagement helps in effectively managing the sustained stakeholder relationships and mental well-being of project stakeholders. Originality/value This research contributes to project management practice, as it reveals the underlying factors of adverse situations occurring during multi-stakeholders' engagement, provides clarity on their components and ranks them in terms of importance for their overall effect on stakeholders' engagement.","[Mysore, Krishnan] Univ South, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Dept IT Engn & Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Kirytopoulos, Konstantinos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Athens, Greece; [Kirytopoulos, Konstantinos; Ahn, Seungjun; Ma, Tony] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Mysore, K (corresponding author), Univ South, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Dept IT Engn & Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",krishmn@yahoo.com,"Kirytopoulos, Konstantinos/H-1348-2018; Mysore, Krishnan/T-1152-2019; AHN, SEUNGJUN/L-7000-2016","Kirytopoulos, Konstantinos/0000-0001-7675-6785; Mysore, Krishnan/0000-0002-5396-3287; AHN, SEUNGJUN/0000-0001-7427-8986",,,,102,2,2,9,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

The most successful outcome for a megaproject would be achieved when it creates values fairly for stakeholder community to satisfy them. Therefore, because of the resource constraints, megaprojects should create value for stakeholders proportional to the value that they put into it. This article proposes a framework for priority setting in stakeholder engagement based on the balance of mutual value creation between the megaproject and stakeholder community. In this way, we developed an innovative and systematic approach by drawing on stakeholder theory, value creation theory, expectation disconfirmation theory, and fuzzy set theory while adopting from data envelopment analysis (DEA) concepts. This study contributes to the theory and practice of engineering management by examining stakeholder engagement to satisfy stakeholders fairly in megaprojects. Particularly, this study categorizes stakeholders based on the proportion of their salience to expectations to three main types: Modest, Fair, and Demanding. This typology will provide a road map for managers to prioritize the responses to stakeholders' expectations. Finally, we applied the proposed approach for a real case of a megaconstruction project (MCP).","[Bahadorestani, Amir] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Civil Engn, Construct Engn & Management Grp, Mashhad 9177948974, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Karlsen, Jan Terje] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Leadership & Org Behav, Nydalsveien 37, N-0484 Oslo, Norway; [Farimani, Nasser Motahari] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Mashhad 9177948974, Razavi Khorasan, Iran","Farimani, NM (corresponding author), Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Mashhad 9177948974, Razavi Khorasan, Iran.",amir.bahador.1990@gmail.com; jan.t.karlsen@bi.no; n.motahari@um.ac.ir,"farimani, nasser motahari/AAD-5115-2019; Bahadorestani, Amir/AAI-2848-2020","farimani, nasser motahari/0000-0001-6828-6736; Bahadorestani, Amir/0000-0001-9802-9618",Research Deputy of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad [48116],"This study was supported in part by the Research Deputy of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, under Grant No. 48116 (dated April 9, 2019).",,110,10,10,13,91,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Planning them occurs to be a complex task. Network methods traditionally applied to construction scheduling prove inefficient in the case of repetitive construction projects (RCPs) due to the increased number of relationships among processes, locations (units), and resources. Frequently, the aim of scheduling RCPs is making the full use of the resources' capacity, thereby ensuring continuity of the crews' work. To achieve this, the planner typically allows discontinuity of some secondary processes to shift resources to the key processes, allowing optional modes of process delivery and introducing soft precedence relations between processes. This paper presents a new way of increasing the continuity of work of a general contractor's crews in RCPs by employing subcontractors' crews. A deterministic mathematical model of the mixed-integer linear problem of a repetitive (nonlinear) project was formulated to find a schedule that minimizes the downtime of the general contractor's crews under constraints of a maximum acceptable total project duration and a maximum acceptable cost of the works commissioned to subcontractors; the model accounts for the limited availability of crews. Application of the model is illustrated by an example.

Based on a modified theoretical framework, we conducted a multiple-case study to explore common combinations and sequencings of specific actions that these stakeholders take to affect construction projects. Seven specific influence strategies were found: (i) inputs withholding, (ii) inputs compromising, (iii) communication, (iv) direct action, (v) coalition building, (vi) conflict escalation and (vii) credibility building. Stakeholders combined the last five strategies in three pairs persuading decision makers to take action. Coalition building - communication was the most prevalent combination that stakeholders use to influence decision-makers. The combination of communication and credibility building was found in cases having environmental disputes. Direct action and conflict escalation were exerted together in projects affecting the locals adversely. Some common patterns of stakeholder strategic actions were also observed. First, direct action came into existence after communication, followed by conflict escalation. Second, after establishing their credibility via persuasive evidence, experts' judgements and the like, stakeholders used those outcomes to communicate to decision-makers. We emphasize the need for full and honest engagement with stakeholders to prevent their adverse influence on construction projects.","[Tan Hai Dang Nguyen] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Chileshe, Nicholas; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen] Univ South Australia, NBERC, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Nguyen, THD (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",tan_hai_dang.nguyen@mymail.unisa.edu.au,"Nguyen, Tan Hai Dang/AAU-3320-2021; Chileshe, Nicholas/F-5482-2010; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen/F-4614-2013","Nguyen, Tan Hai Dang/0000-0002-6333-4361; Chileshe, Nicholas/0000-0002-1981-7518; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen/0000-0001-9639-2624",,,,51,7,7,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

While realizing the technical necessities, they also serve as an instrument towards multiple and often conflicting objectives during financial constraints. An optimal proactive maintenance strategy therefore should comprise a multiannual maintenance action plan optimized on different criteria corresponding to owners' objectives under existing constraints. This study offers a systematic approach based on a condition-deterioration model to address the complexity involved in decision making regarding optimized maintenance and renovation planning. Life-cycle cost analysis in form of Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) is used for the economic assessment of maintenance/renovation scenarios. In this paper, the model is used to compare the economy of different maintenance/renovation plans in a chosen scenario in order to determine the optimal maintenance interval for a single and a combination of building components. Two facade elements, windows and facade rendering, are used to illustrate the application of the proposed method. This method is intended to help decision makers at both design and post-construction phases in the choice of both building components and maintenance/renovation strategies.","[Farahani, Abolfazl; Wallbaum, Holger; Dalenback, Jan-Olof] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Sven Hultins Gata 6, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden","Farahani, A (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Sven Hultins Gata 6, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",abolfazl.farahani@chalmers.se,"Wallbaum, Holger/B-6272-2008; Farahani, Abolfazl Sousanabadi/AAK-4585-2020","Wallbaum, Holger/0000-0001-5809-9400; /0000-0002-2221-7492; Dalenback, Jan-Olof/0000-0001-8771-0416",Swedish energy agencySwedish Energy Agency [37578-2],This work was supported by the Swedish energy agency under Grant [37578-2].,,38,21,21,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Active leading indicators, for example capturing hazardous proximity situations between workers-on-foot and heavy construction equipment, provide an additional metric for construction site personnel safety performance without incurring accidents. This article presents a method for recording, identifying, and analyzing interactive hazardous near miss situations between workers-on-foot and heavy construction equipment. Spatiotemporal GPS data are analyzed to automatically measure a hazard index that is visualized in form of a heat map. The graphical representation of computationally identified individual values in up-to-date building information models allows automatically generated personalized safety performance reports. These are based on specific near miss locations, environmental conditions, and equipment types. The presented research is based on previous isolated research efforts in equipment blind spot measurement, real-time location tracking, and proximity alert technology. It contributes the definitions and experimental validation of new safety parameters such as entry of worker-on-foot in equipment blind spot to determine the root causes that lead to equipment- and visibility-related fatalities on construction sites. Analysis of these root causes is important in preventing accidents in the first place. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Sadly, the same cannot be said of developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where accident figures are extremely high. The aim of this study is to examine the influence of the contextual environment within which Ghanaian construction small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) manage occupational health and safety (OH&S). A questionnaire survey was administered to construction SMEs to better understand the health and safety management practices and associated problems followed up by field interviews to explore key issues identified by the survey. The results of the study highlight the institutional structure for implementing OH&S standards, prevailing economic climate, and extended family culture as challenges to the management of OH&S. The study identifies low literacy levels, low socioeconomic status of workers, owner/managers' ignorance of their OH&S responsibilities, commitment to extended family obligations, and ineffective OH&S administration as key factors limiting the capacity of construction SMEs to manage OH&S effectively. The study concludes that effective institutional structure and an enabling socioeconomic environment are needed to enhance the OH&S performance of SMEs and advocates for more proactive OH&S management that take into consideration the work cultures of SMEs.","[Kheni, Nongiba A.] Tamale Polytech, Dept Civil & Bldg Engn, Tamale, Ghana; [Kheni, Nongiba A.; Gibb, Alistair G.

This study aims to explain critical antecedents and cognitive mechanisms of construction workers' SCBs based on an integrated theoretical framework of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and norm activation model (NAM). This study was conducted by distributing a questionnaire survey to 719 construction workers in China. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated that personal norms (PNs), attitudes toward SCB (ATT), subjective norms (SNs), and perceived behavioral control (PBC) have significant positive impacts on the intention of SCB, and the size of direct effects decreases in turn. The study also confirmed the significant indirect effects of SN on behavioral intention by way of ATT, PBC, and PN; ATT, PN, and PBC predicted SCB through the mediating processes of SCB intention. The study demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the integrative model in predicting workers' intentions to adopt SCBs and provides targeted suggestions and strategies for the sustainable development of safety management. These findings have meaningful implications for academic research on SCBs and the industrial practice of safety management.","[Liu, Qing; Jiang, Hui; Wang, Shengcheng] Xuzhou Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Xuzhou 221018, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Na; Wang, Wenshun; Wang, Jianping] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Mech & Civil Engn, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Xu, N (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Mech & Civil Engn, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",liuqingcumt@126.com; lizzy_yiyi@163.com,,"liu, qing/0000-0002-3080-9922","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71901206, 51904270]; Major Research Program of Natural Science of Higher Education of Jiangsu Province, China [19KJA570001]; General Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province [2019SJA0995]; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Building Energy Saving and Construction Technology [SJXTBZ1704]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71901206 and 51904270); Major Research Program of Natural Science of Higher Education of Jiangsu Province, China (19KJA570001); General Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province (2019SJA0995); and Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Building Energy Saving and Construction Technology (No. SJXTBZ1704).

Although the most reliable approach identified in the literature is currently artificial neural network (ANN), it has weaknesses that negatively affect CP. In this study, a new approach called support vector machines (SVM) has been used to forecast a contractor's deviation from a client's objectives. In order to test the model, CP for 250 virtual contractors was solved. The proposed model had a great generalization in linear, nonlinear, noisy and inductive environments. The Results showed that SVM could reliably perform even with a small amount of training data. Also when compared to ANN, SVM showed an overall better performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

At the core of the model is a specialized absorbing Markov chain, which stochastically models the construction product fabrication process while considering quality-induced rework uncertainty. The model parameters are dynamically updated using real-time quality management and cost management information to achieve more accurate and reliable simulation outputs. Furthermore, two types of decision-support metrics are developed to support rework cost management processes, namely (1)rework cost estimation during the project planning phase, and (2)rework cost control during the project execution phase. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the functionalities of the model and the implementation of the decision-support metrics. Finally, the proposed approach is integrated into the previously developed simulation-based analytics framework and implemented by an industrial pipe fabrication company in Edmonton, Canada. The presented case study demonstrates the applicability and feasibility of the proposed approach to industrial pipe welding processes.","[Ji, Wenying; AbouRizk, Simaan M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 9105 116 ST,5-080 NREF, Edmonton, AB T6G 2W2, Canada","AbouRizk, SM (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 9105 116 ST,5-080 NREF, Edmonton, AB T6G 2W2, Canada.",wenying.ji@ualberta.ca; abourizk@ualberta.ca,"Ji, Wenying/R-7535-2017; Ji, Wenying/M-3003-2019","Ji, Wenying/0000-0002-1222-2191; Ji, Wenying/0000-0002-1222-2191; AbouRizk, Simaan/0000-0002-4788-9121",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Collaborative Research and Development Grant [CRDPJ 492657],"This research is funded by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Collaborative Research and Development Grant (CRDPJ 492657).

Deviation from base plans can be found using project control methods, continuous assessment of the schedule, determining progress percentages and earned value parameters. In such circumstances, conflicts might arise between contractor and owner as restoring project's original schedule needs added expenditures by the contractor. Moreover, continuation of the previous procedure and late completion of the project will cause the owner damage. In this research, a mathematical model using game theory has been presented. The model investigates the behaviour and strategies of the parties involved in a delayed project through bargaining. It helps owners and contractors gain deeper understanding of the given delay problem, get a fairly accurate analysis of their situation and consider possible strategies in facing with such circumstances without spending a long and inconclusive time. The points which both parties can agree rationally proposed with a numerical example. Results of the model indicate that parameters involved in the problem are effective in changing the range width of negotiation. In special cases, such as disproportionate delay penalty, these parameters even make it neutral in negotiation. Step by step analysis of the model showed which features can threaten negotiation.","[Khanzadi, Mostafa; Chalekaee, Alireza] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Construct & Engn Management Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Eshtehardian, Ehsan] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Construct & Project Management Architecture Dept, Tehran, Iran","Eshtehardian, E (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Construct & Project Management Architecture Dept, Tehran, Iran.",eshtehardian@modares.ac.ir,"Khanzadi, Mostafa/S-9326-2018",,,,,39,9,9,2,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

The purpose of the study is to assess risk factors affecting contractors' cash flow for construction projects and examine their influence on contractors' cash flow projections. In line with quantitative survey approach adopted for the study, 193 copies of a structured questionnaire were administered while 130 valid responses were received to give a response rate of 67.4%. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics and Kruskal Wallis. Findings indicate that the 5 top rated risk factors affecting contractor's cash flow were 'delay in payment by client', 'delay in delivery of materials', contractor's lack of resources, exchange rate, and inflation while the 5 least rated risk factors by respondents were currency of cost data, disagreement over retention, over valuation, adjustment of prime cost sums, and force majeure. It was also discovered that 'contractor's lack of resources' had the highest severity of influence according to the view of respondents. The study concludes that cash flow projections of contractors handling construction projects in south-south Nigeria are prone to risks, most of which are significant. However, it was established that the five top risks which should be of concern to contractors are delay in payment by client, delay in delivery of materials, contractor's lack of resources, exchange rate, and inflation. The study recommends that contractors and other stakeholders could consider putting in place risk control measures to counter those risks identified in this study as likely to have high severity of influence on cash flow with a view towards bolstering project delivery.","[Ikediashi, Dubem I.] Univ Uyo, Fac Environm Studies, Dept Bldg, Uyo, Nigeria; [Okolie, Kevin C.] Nnamdi Azikiwe Univ, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Bldg, Awka, Nigeria","Ikediashi, DI (corresponding author), Univ Uyo, Fac Environm Studies, Dept Bldg, Uyo, Nigeria.",dubemikediashi@uniuyo.edu.ng,,,,,,35,0,0,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

This practice is termed contractor acceptance testing (CAT) in this paper. Although CAT has helped transportation agencies to deal with a shrinking workforce and intensive construction schedules, it has been controversial. This paper provides insights into the technical and conceptual pitfalls of CAT. The technical pitfalls are revealed through Monte Carlo-based computer simulations of pavement specifications that use CAT. These simulations show that the verification process, which relies on the statistical F-test and t-test, is unreliable and can lead to erroneous pay decisions. The conceptual pitfalls are revealed by demonstrating that CAT encourages a quality-control approach that focuses on defect detection and containment, rather than defect prevention. Finally, potential alternatives and improvements to CAT are provided. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000113.

Even though previous studies have revealed various legal issues related to BIM, little is known regarding the contractual practices of BIM. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to explore the contractual practices between the BIM consultant and employer in detail. Design/methodology/approach An explanatory case study was carried out on four large BIM-enabled construction projects in China. Findings The contractual practices differed from one project to another in terms of ownership and intellectual property rights (IPRs) of the BIM model, roles of the BIM consultant, liability of the BIM consultant in the event of errors and delays of the BIM model, and BIM-related costs and payments. Some of the interesting findings are as follows: the employer shall retain the ownership and IPRs of the BIM model, the BIM consultant shall provide a warranty to ensure usability of the BIM model after project handover, the BIM consultant shall pay for damages or losses if the BIM model fails to deliver and the costs of BIM implementation shall be borne by both contracting parties. Originality/value This study provides a fresh, realistic insight on the development of plausible contractual practices between the BIM consultant and employer and the findings can be used to improve BIM contract protocols in future projects.","[Liao, Xiaofeng] Chongqing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Engn, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Lee, Cen Ying] Univ Reading Malaysia, Iskandar Puteri, Malaysia; [Chong, Heap-Yih] Curtin Univ, Bentley, WA, Australia","Chong, HY (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Bentley, WA, Australia.",lxf@cqust.edu.cn; celine.lee@reading.edu.my; heap-yih.chong@curtin.edu.au,"Chong, Heap-Yih/M-8354-2017","Chong, Heap-Yih/0000-0002-6080-7530; Lee, Cen Ying/0000-0001-6222-2061",,,,26,5,5,14,62,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

To investigate the current and ideal cultures, data were gathered among the key stakeholders by means of a survey study with 72 respondents divided over 12 companies. The respondents rated the current and desired cultures by using the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument, which belongs to the Competing Values Framework. The investigations show many similarities and differences between the stakeholder perspectives of the current and the idealized partnering project cultures. Mainly, the General Contractors desire more cooperative behaviors than the (Sub-)Contractors, and the Investors desire more pronounced flexibility than the General Contractors. All stakeholders desire a cultural change from highly competitive behaviors toward more cooperation. Changes in terms of clear procedures or more flexibility are only desired by the Designers. Defining both the current and an ideal partnering project culture enables academics and project managers to compare their actual project cultures to an ideal situation. With such an approach, academics and project managers could measure whether new tools or changes in resources affect their project cultures toward a partnering project culture.","[Luhr, Gunnar J.; Radujkovic, Mladen] Alma Mater Europaea ECM, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [Bosch-Rekveldt, Marian G.

During the last two decades, many stakeholder theories and empirical studies have sprouted. Although previous studies have contributed to the development of stakeholder theory, it seems that these theoretical advances have not been fully adopted and acknowledged in practices, especially in megaprojects. The purpose of this paper is to explore the evolution of stakeholder analysis and engagement practices adopted in the Australian megaprojects over the last two decades. Design/methodology/approach Four mega construction projects are described and analysed in this study. Secondary data were first assembled in order to get general knowledge of each case. Interviews were conducted with the project directors. Project documents were collected from the project teams and reviewed. Wherever the project information was unclear, e-mails were sent to the directors and the team members to confirm the details. Findings Project teams have started to apply snowball rolling and stakeholder attribute assessment methods to analyse stakeholders. However, there is still a way to adopt the network analysis perspective because the project teams are reluctant to use complicated tools which need specialists' assistance. The stakeholder engagement practices have evolved to an extent where the project teams monitor the dynamics of stakeholders' requirements. Projects teams have identified the importance of continuity to manage stakeholders in these massive projects. However, a structured method selection mechanism for stakeholder engagement has not been developed. Originality/value This study will help academics to understand the adoption progress and status of stakeholder management methods.","[Yang, Rebecca Jing] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jayasuriya, Sajani; Zhang, Guomin] RMIT Univ, Sch Civil Environm & Chem Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Gunarathna, Chathuri; Arashpour, Mehrdad] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Xue, Xiaolong] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Yang, RJ (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",rebecca.yang@rmit.edu.au,,"Arashpour, Mehrdad/0000-0003-4148-3160; Yang, Rebecca/0000-0002-0418-1967; Zhang, Guomin Kevin/0000-0002-3503-7431",,,,53,12,12,4,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

How to synchronize the schedules of concurrent projects at different levels to optimize the allocation of fabrication resources (particularly skilled laborers) is identified as a matter of pressing concern in the industry. In collaboration with an industry partner in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, we (1) developed a unified work breakdown structure (WBS) based on project management functions such as bidding, production planning, estimating, and scheduling; (2) synchronized schedules for various management functions by implementing a dual-level multiproject optimization scheduling framework; and (3) developed a multiproject scheduling tool to implement the research in practice.

The relationship between job demands, job control, workplace support, and experiences of stress in the South African construction context is investigated, using hierarchical regression, factor analysis and structural equation modeling to explore the strength of thirteen factor relationships with perceived stress. Data were gathered from an on-line questionnaire survey response sample of 676 architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers. Predictors displaying a significant relationship with occupational stress are the presence of work life imbalance, the need to 'prove' oneself, hours worked per week, working to tight deadlines, and support from line managers in difficult situations at work. Existing theories of occupational stress are confirmed but not completely supported. The construction industry should give attention to how the need to work long hours is justified. Organizations should look to improving managerial and collegial support for construction professionals, but be careful in engaging in socializing and project team-building activities. Further research will need to focus more deeply on construction-specific job demand factors; explore why women professionals appear to experience more stress than men; and aim to develop reliable early-warning detection techniques for construction professionals.

This paper presents the authors' work in the area of formal axiology-based value analysis of building projects. Axiology is a theory of value and worth. The formal axiology is a theory-based, semantic model for analyzing and assessing the value (worth) of building projects based on the environmental, social, and economic values of stakeholders (e.g.,energy conservation, safety, economic growth). The first step towards developing the formal axiology is discovering stakeholder values in the context of building projects. Value discovery is the process of identifying the values that are relevant to a particular system. In this paper, the authors focus on presenting their value-discovery work for residential, commercial, and educational building projects. Stakeholder values were discovered from project documents, value literature, and a stakeholder survey. The paper discusses the survey design, implementation, and results. Overall, the results show that, on average, all values are at least moderately important to all stakeholders. The results also show that although there is a general agreement on the importance ranking of values among stakeholders, there are significant differences in the ranks across different stakeholder groups and across different project types. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing both theoretical and empirical knowledge on stakeholder value discovery; it could facilitate value-sensitive decision-making by embodying stakeholder values into project planning and design towards better synergy between human values and the built environment.","[Zhang, Lu; El-Gohary, Nora M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 205 N Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","El-Gohary, NM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 205 N Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",luzhang7@illinois.edu; gohary@illinois.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1254679],"The authors would like to thank the National Science Foundation (NSF).

The results of a survey on the prioritization of these 31 CSFs reveal that LCM projects involve more stakeholders than do general construction projects and require a correspondingly wider range of changes during each project. To identify more systematic and strategic approaches to stakeholder management in LCM projects, a framework was developed through factor analysis and focus-group interviews with project management experts. The framework is composed of the following five agendas: clear understanding of stakeholders, clear definition of the project, effective communication, responding to environmental changes, and social cooperation. The analysis results show that LCM projects require a stronger emphasis on responding to environmental changes and social cooperation. These results, along with the CSF priorities, reveal the necessity of taking customized approaches to LCM projects. The results of this analysis are expected to help LCM project managers effectively manage stakeholders.

After positioning PPP in the current stakeholder management theory, a comparative case study analysis of four PPP infrastructure projects demonstrates the relevance and importance of stakeholder inclusion in PPPs. The case study findings indicate that a PPP makes the stakeholder environment more complex to manage, due to the increasing importance of the stakeholder context and dynamics. Hence, allocating stakeholder responsibilities between the public initiator and private consortium becomes problematic as it goes hand in hand with balancing between reactive and proactive responses to stakeholder claims. In order to cope with the PPP specific stakeholder characteristics, the use of a dynamic dual stakeholder management tool is recommended as well as the identification of governance structures that allow the sharing and division of responsibilities between stakeholders.

The method used an inductive thematic analysis to reveal two major themes: one related to the multiple stakeholders involved in a project and the other to project structure. Further analysis showed three new success dimensions linked directly to the perception of project success: benefit to the stakeholder group, client/customer specific issues and time/cost/quality.

Our study on the perspective of contractors explores whether and how different dimensions of interorganizational justice affect relational behavior in construction projects and the moderating role of owner's asset specificity. On the basis of survey data from the construction industry, the empirical results reveal that if contractors perceive higher procedural justice or interactional justice, the contractor's relational behavior conforms to relational norms more. Furthermore, the owner's asset specificity dilutes the positive impact of interactional justice on the contractor's relational behavior. The findings contribute to strengthening the understanding of project management and interorganizational justice while guiding owners to pay more attention to the process of contract execution in practice and the appropriate investment of specific assets in projects to improve the contractor's relational behavior.","[Lu, Wenxue; Guo, Wenqian; Zhu, Qingling] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China","Guo, WQ (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",luwenxue@tju.edu.cn; gwq_tju@163.com; zhuyingling0903@163.com,,"Guo, Wenqian/0000-0002-8983-8920",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71772135],The authors would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) for its financial support (Grant No. 71772135).

However, in practice, owners often failed to build an efficient cooperative relationship via contracts, resulting in a lacking of appropriate justice. Furthermore, due to a lack of available empirical research, the influence of contractual flexibility on the cooperative behavior of contractors requires further investigation. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by conducting empirical research from the perspective of justice perception. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model was developed and a series of hypotheses were proposed. Then, partial least squares structural equation modeling analyses were conducted on a sample of 188 respondents. Findings - The results show that contractual content and executing flexibility both have a positive influence on the cooperative behavior of a contractor, which was partially mediated by distribution, procedural, and interactional justice perceptions. Moreover, content flexibility has a significant impact on all three types of justice perception, and the execution of flexibility has more impact on interactional justice compared to other justice perceptions. Originality/value - The findings contribute to an improved understanding of how contractual flexibility affects the cooperative behavior of contractors, indicating that the owner could develop a fair exchange relationship through flexible contracting and motivation of the other party.","[Song, Haoyang; Wang, Peng] Dalian Univ Technol, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Fangwei] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Klakegg, Ole Jonny] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Trondheim, Norway","Klakegg, OJ (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Trondheim, Norway.",ole.jonny.klakegg@ntnu.no,,"Klakegg, Ole Jonny/0000-0002-1767-0911",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71372085],"This study received funding support from the project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Number 71372085), which should have the authors' acknowledgment.

This results in severe problems for the construction companies which do not enter into the process until all the important decisions have been made. In particular, the rate of utilization of their facilities is more or less fully dependent on other actors rather than themselves. Recently, the larger construction companies with nationwide and international activities have initiated changes to take over the construction process and assume the leading position within the project coalition. This has been achieved by integrating parts of the construction project that have been under the command of other actors. At the beginning of the process, this concerns part of the work traditionally performed by the architect on behalf of the client, at the other end it concerns the function of the client itself. So it is the producer who - inside a deep crisis which affects the whole of the industry over the last few years - takes command inside the construction process. This will result in restructuring the entire industry and will cause severe problems for other actors, in particular the small and medium construction companies degraded to subcontractors only.","BAQ Forschungsinst Beschaftigung Arbeit Qualifika, Hsch Bremen, Bremen, Germany","Syben, G (corresponding author), BAQ Forschungsinst Beschaftigung Arbeit Qualifika, Hsch Bremen, Bremen, Germany.",,,,,,,12,2,2,0,1,ROUTLEDGE,LONDON,"11 NEW FETTER LANE, LONDON EC4P 4EE, ENGLAND",0961-3218,,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

The key indicators of success currently used on most construction projects include meeting project duration, cost, and quality targets. Project decision makers seldom consider customer expectations related to project-related environmental impact. Quantitative assessments of project-related emissions should be conducted during the project-planning phase. Trade-off optimization among project duration (time), project cost, and project environmental impact is necessary to enhance the overall construction project benefit. This paper develops a novel optimization algorithm, the opposition-based multiple-objective differential evolution (OMODE), to solve the time-cost-environmental impact tradeoff (TCET) problem. This novel algorithm uses an opposition-based learning technique for population initialization and for generation jumping. Opposition numbers are used to improve the exploration and convergence performance of the optimization process. A numerical case study of tunnel construction demonstrates the ability of OMODE-generated nondominated solutions to assist project managers in selecting a plan to optimize TCET, an operation that is otherwise difficult and time-consuming. Comparisons with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), multiple-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), and multiple-objective differential evolution (MODE) verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Despite acknowledging that 'no project is an island', project management theoly (being originally a child of Scientific Management) has drawn on reductionism, i.e. the practice of simplifying the description of a complex phenomenon in order to better grasp it. Project stalceholder management theory has been heavily influenced by this approach, and the unintended consequence is that the simplicity of the stakeholder conceptualization makes it difficult for project representatives to predict stalceholder behavior. In the paper, we suggest the concept 'shadows of the context' as a substitute for narrow perceptions of 'What's in it for me?'. Advantages and disadvantages of a reductionist approach versus the richer and more profound and holistic 'shadows of the context' approach within stakeholder analysis are discussed.

The Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management projects (EPCM) are complex, customised, and produce highly unique products. Project management body of knowledge (PMBOK) highlights that projects and the workforce are generally temporary in nature. Literature reviews and media reports show that EPCM projects are poorly managed in Africa by Western companies. Some of these problems are caused by a gap between companies and projects in Africa. To take up these challenges, this paper presents a research methodology that combines qualitative and quantitative (observation and survey of practising project managers) working in large EPCM projects, to understand local stakeholders' needs and the iterative improvement of communication directly upon projects. Multi-method research technique was used for this study. The paper shows the practical feasibility of the management approach using field observation. The field observation provides evidence that the qualitative approach is well suited to support the development and implementation of effective and efficient mechanisms in large projects. The research has revealed that stakeholders should be effectively integrated in the organisation management processes to improve project success. The research makes a significant contribution to stakeholder management by presenting how Western project managers should manage stakeholders in EPCM project in Africa.","[Tchumtcha Wembe, Paulin] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Construct Econ & Management, Johannesburg, South Africa","Wembe, PT (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Construct Econ & Management, Johannesburg, South Africa.",pwembe@gmail.com,,,,,,60,0,0,1,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

A major limitation of this research, however, was the nature of the sample; it was heterogeneous (i.e., a combination of U.S. and international projects) and the sample was restricted to 18 projects. Building upon initial research, this paper re-examines the association between quality and safety using a homogeneous sample of 569 projects, which were derived from an Australian construction company with an annual turnover in excess of $1 billion Australian dollars (AU$). A total of 19,314 nonconformances and 17,783 injuries were used to determine the validity and reliability of previous research. A weak association between quality and safety performance was found (p < 0.01). The p-values did not indicate any significant association between first aid and quality rates, except for the injury rate and rework frequency per million scope, which yielded an r-value of 0.307 and p-value 0.046 that is significant at 0.01 level. An association, however, between injuries and rework was identified (r(2) = 0.70). The discrepancy between this research's findings and that of previous work led to an examination of the issues of using ratios in correlation analysis. Thus, the statistical and arithmetic issues associated with the use of ratios are discussed, and it is recommended that estimating the relationships between quality and safety should be examined using regression techniques or analysis of covariance. Linear regression, therefore, was performed with the injury data as the dependent variable, and rework frequency and personnel hours as the independent variables. The regression results demonstrated that there is a significant association between injuries, and rework and personnel hours; it was revealed that both predictors accounted for 68.2% of the explained variability in injury frequency. The replication of the initial research has enabled a significant advancement in knowledge about relationship between quality and safety performance.

However, linear schedules are limited in graphical comparisons. A slip chart from the aerospace industry, which recorded launch dates on two axes of time, is rediscovered as inspiration for an improved tool. However, whereas its original form could only track points in time, schedule activities must be represented as ranges across time. Therefore, additional theory is needed to extend slip charts toward being able to handle linear schedules. To create such a layout, this research systematically extends its conventions and capabilities. A conversion algorithm for linear schedules is derived. New features are introduced for a comprehensive approach. In particular, buffers that represent minimum and also maximum constraints between activities are investigated and converted.

To date, project teams have limited methodological support for PSM: Existing methods are dominantly static and internally focused, making it difficult to manage so-called external stakeholders, who are not under the authority of the project manager. This work aims to improve PSM practice by closing the methodological gap. We developed a novel decision-support methodology, based on Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) modeling that leverages stakeholders' public comments to anticipate the project's impacts on them and to make conflicts between stakeholder interests and project objectives transparent.

Project management is an essential operational tool and process that is utilized to effectively and efficiently manage resources, tasks and activities, and associated timelines. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility that failure is a result of different interpretations of the criteria and factors used for success by multiple stakeholder groups. Currently, there is no recorded theory to determine project success within the project management literature, which includes both the perspective of multiple stakeholder groups and shared use of success dimensions for a given project. This omission is the basis of the current work, which explores the impact of using all stakeholder views as opposed to a selected few to define project success.

Three linked studies conducted at a large IT consulting firm examine the nature and implications of this process. In the first, we address what it means to be a top performer as an IT consultant, both at the entry level and in more senior roles. The second study demonstrates incongruity among various stakeholders in their perceptions of which attributes are of primary and lesser importance as determinants of excellent performance. The third study examines the effects of this incongruence on consultants' attitudes and performance. This research presents a novel operationalization of incongruity that is particularly relevant for understanding IT personnel, and one that has practical implications for their socialization and management.","[Joshi, K.

Social scientific approaches offer insights on the lack of progress. However, few previous studies have investigated psychological factors despite the pivotal role of the individual professional decision-maker. The aim was to understand what personal motivations drive architectural designers to pursue sustainable design in their work and whether non-environmental motivations can drive sustainable outcomes. Twenty-eight architectural designers in 14 small firms in the London area were interviewed. Thematic analysis was conducted, informed by the self-determination theory of motivation. Although extrinsic motivators were noted, autonomous motivations including a moral imperative and personal commitment predominated. Further, the participants demonstrated other self-determined motivations including realization of self-identity, pursuit of quality in design and awareness of their work's impact on people. These autonomous motivations align closely with sustainability principles including design for durability, high standards and technical expertise. The findings point to the risks of reliance on extrinisic motivators such as regulation, and the opportunities to engage architectural designers more extensively in sustainable design by linking sustainability to autonomous motivations.","[Murtagh, Niamh; Roberts, Aeli; Hind, Richard] UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, 1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7HB, England","Murtagh, N (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, 1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7HB, England.",n.murtagh@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,82,37,37,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

To clearly visualize, track, and mitigate them, graphical and analytical tools are needed. But traditional bar charts do not clearly show delays, and network charts all but hide them. Neither facilitates side-by-side comparisons of schedule updates. Networks can be converted into a modified slip chart from the aerospace industry, which is particularly adept at analyzing delays. Contributions to the body of knowledge include the ability to communicate schedule information more efficiently with less ink, yet in a time-scaled manner, including lead or lag constraints, performing side-by-side comparisons that immediately reveal float gain or loss versus criticality, rapidly identifying underperforming activities, and scrutinizing delay events and assigning responsibility to project participants. To validate the new approach, a delay example from the literature is reanalyzed to gain insights into schedule performance. Comparing the network conversion with a previously developed linear schedule one indicates that the entire approach provides a single framework to plan and control project schedules, which thus can be called the Unified Diagramming Method.","[Araujo, Lissa Gomes] Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Civil Engn, Construct Engn & Management Program, Washington, DC 20064 USA; [Araujo, Lissa Gomes] Minist Educ, Coordenacao Aperfeicoamento Pessoal Nivel Super C, BR-70040020 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Lucko, Gunnar] Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Civil Engn, Civil Engn, Washington, DC 20064 USA; [Lucko, Gunnar] Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Civil Engn, Construct Engn & Management Program, Washington, DC 20064 USA","Lucko, G (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Civil Engn, Civil Engn, Washington, DC 20064 USA.; Lucko, G (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Civil Engn, Construct Engn & Management Program, Washington, DC 20064 USA.",lucko@cua.edu,,"Araujo, Lissa/0000-0002-9517-1202","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES Foundation), Ministry of Education, Brazil","Financial support by Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES Foundation), Ministry of Education, Brazil for the first author is gratefully acknowledged.

However, it remains unclear how parties properly interact with each other to create greater value in their cooperative relationships. Based on the paradox theory, this study applied the construct of behavior tension to describe the tension between cooperative and competitive forms of behavior, a pair of two contradictory forces coexisting in owner-contractor partnerships. This study then explored the impact of behavior tension on value creation. Using data from 161 responses, the interactive effect of dependence asymmetry and behavior tension on value creation is examined. The data were analyzed using hierarchical regression. The results show an inverse U-shaped relationship between behavior tension and value creation in owner-contractor partnerships, implying that a balance between cooperation and competition, more than either behavior alone, is helpful in creating value. Meanwhile, dependence asymmetry weakens this inverse U-shaped relationship. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in project and engineering management by adding greater variance to partners' behavior (i.e., not just cooperation or competition), and by potentially enriching our understanding of how to rearrange interactive behavior among partners in facilitating value creation. Our findings reveal that, to create greater value for each other, engineering managers should change their cognition regarding cooperation and competition, and try to take advantage of the merits of these two opposing forces.","[Qian, Qinzhen] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Construct Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lianying] Tianjin Univ, Struct Engn, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Cao, Tingting] Tianjin Univ, Management Sci & Engn, Tianjin, Peoples R China","Qian, QZ (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Construct Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",qqz2006@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71902132, 71872126]",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [grant numbers 71902132; 71872126].,,128,0,0,11,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1042-9247,2377-0643,,ENG MANAG J,EMJ-Eng.

Yet the increased use of alternate project delivery methods, along with owner-perceived concerns over construction performance, has led many owners to introduce qualifications-based selection criteria into their procurement systems. As a result, construction contractors are tasked with preparation of qualifications-based proposal submittals ever more frequently. Contractors must therefore develop strategies to consistently differentiate their qualifications from those of their their competitors, which can lead to more favorable owner evaluation scores and ultimately improve their hit rate. This paper performed a content analysis of 71 contractor proposals containing both successful and unsuccessful bids. Regression results indicate that contractor project management proposals receive more favorable owner evaluation scores when contractor-controlled, design-related, and concealed conditions content are emphasized. Regression results show that contractor scope alternate proposals are encouraged to provide a comprehensive review of potential scope options to enhance the project and ensure the associated cost and schedule impacts are clearly defined.","[Lines, Brian C.; Kumar, Gagan Gowda Ravi] Univ Kansas, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, 1530 W 15th St,Learned Hall 2150, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Lines, BC (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, 1530 W 15th St,Learned Hall 2150, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",brianlines@ku.edu; g082r891@ku.edu,,"Lines, Brian/0000-0002-7998-1053",,,,85,4,4,1,34,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

However, stories of project failures are often heard in this rapid cultural building boom. In fact, many pitfalls in developing large cultural building projects (CBPs) are associated to the stakeholders since they are the actual central figures of a project. As such, addressing stakeholder complexity and understanding major pitfalls in CBPs from stakeholder perspective are crucial to the successful management of these projects, yet relevant empirical studies remain lacking. To fill this gap, case study of a large performing arts center was conducted. A holistic stakeholder analysis approach, which applies both rationalistic methods (e.g. social network analysis) and empirical methods (e.g. survey and interviews), was adopted to address stakeholder complexity in the case. Three major pitfalls in large CBPs were identified, including 'developing accurate end users' requirements', 'balancing between aesthetics, functionality and resources', and 'leadership team makeup, vision, charisma and learning stance'. Their underlying causes and possible solutions were discussed. This study contributes theoretically by illustrating a holistic approach of analyzing and addressing stakeholder complexity, and provides practical value by understanding the pitfalls of CBPs from stakeholder perspective.

It adopts a duality lens in exploring whether and how these tensions materialize through stakeholder voices. In contrast to traditional linear and unitarist thinking in project management, duality thinking may lead to project management practices that acknowledge, appreciate, and accommodate the tensions originating from dilemmas inherent in complex projects. We propose three stakeholder roles that can contribute to project managers' tension awareness and inform duality management.","[Boonstra, Albert] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Informat Management, Groningen, Netherlands; [van Offenbeek, Marjolein A.

These potential benefits cannot be achieved, however, if construction workers do not recognize the value of wearable devices as well as the details of their usage. This study thus investigates determinants for workers' adoption of wearable technology in the occupational work context. Specifically, the scope of this study is to test hypotheses regarding workers' intention to adopt two representative wearable devices for occupational safety and health, a smart vest with an embedded indoor GPS for location tracking, and a wristband-type wearable activity tracker (i.e., wristband) with physiological sensors. The research results indicate that perceived usefulness (PU), social influence (SI), and perceived privacy risk (PR) are associated with workers' intention to adopt (IA) both smart vest and wristband. Also, workers' experiences using wearable devices positively moderates the association between PU and IA of smart vest and negatively moderates the association between SI and IA of smart vest. In the work context, foremen are more likely to be influenced by PU than workers with regard to using a wristband. By considering the different functions, benefits, and challenges of each device, and by taking into account individual and job characteristics, the results of this study provide crucial insight into the process of motivating workers to adopt each device in their work, which can promote the continued and appropriate use of wearable technology in occupational safety and health management.","[Choi, Byungjoo] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tishman Construct Management Program, 2350 Hayward St,Suite 1316 GG Brown Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hwang, Sungjoo] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Architectural & Urban Syst Engn, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, SangHyun] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tishman Construct Management Program, 2350 Hayward St,Suite 2340 GG Brown Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Lee, S (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tishman Construct Management Program, 2350 Hayward St,Suite 2340 GG Brown Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",bjoochoi@umich.edu; hwangsj@ewha.ac.kr; shdpm@umich.edu,"Choi, Byungjoo/H-9576-2016","Choi, Byungjoo/0000-0002-3904-4305; Lee, SangHyun/0000-0002-2246-7440",University of Michigan third century initiative,"The authors would like to acknowledge their industry partners for their help in data collection, as well as anonymous participants who participated in the survey.

However, CMCs' services, if not carefully managed, cannot bring salient contributions. This paper aims to empirically examine how clients' delegation to CMCs affects client-consultant capability integration in project management processes. Based on a comprehensive literature review, a conceptual capability integration model was developed. A triangulated approach was adopted to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Social network analysis (SNA) and case analysis provide exploratory evidence on the capability integration model. Partial least square based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analyses tested the model hypotheses statistically. The results suggest that both clients' and CMCs' capabilities contribute to project management processes, although clients' contributions are more significant. Delegating more responsibilities to CMCs better utilizes their capabilities and at the same time does not restrict clients' contributions. Theoretically, these findings provide empirical support to the theory of temporal project organization and map the client-consultant collaboration interface. In practice, clients should better utilize CMCs' capabilities by designing appropriate responsibility delegation systems based on the revealed capability integration mechanism.

This study adopts agent-based modeling (ABM) to understand the effectiveness of two distinct co-worker-safety-support actions on the safety performance of a construction project. Based on the risk theory, the ABM model simulates a construction site where worker agents reinforce steel bars with the likelihood of suffering crane-related incidents. The results indicate that both co-worker-support actions can significantly reduce the occurrence of nonfatal incidents but shows little influence in fatal incidents, and in reducing high-severity incidents, the action of warning peers to leave the hazardous area has the same effectiveness as reminding peers to wear Personal Protective Equipment. The present study provides a fresh insight into the safety-related role of coworkers: not only reveals how the local-level effects of co-workers' safety assistance emerge the system-level consequences, but demonstrates the effectiveness of specific peer-support actions on three levels of construction safety performance, and thereby extends our existing body of knowledge on co-worker safety support in the construction field.","[Ji, Tingting; Wei, Hsi-Hsien] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Jiayu] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Wei, HH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",hhwei@polyu.edu.hk,"Chen, Jiayu/P-8048-2019; Wei, Hsi Hsein/AAR-4108-2020","Chen, Jiayu/0000-0001-9396-0059; JI, Tingting/0000-0001-7955-5495; Wei, Hsi-Hsien/0000-0002-7024-0726",,,,68,5,5,7,15,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

This is the world's first cap-and-trade programme to cover buildings in the commercial, industrial and public sectors. Its main aim is to reduce CO2 emissions from energy consumption in existing buildings in urban areas; therefore, it is called an 'urban cap-and-trade programme'. The appropriateness and effectiveness of this demand-side mechanism are examined, as well as the key policy and strategy components for introducing this new mechanism. Crucial factors for the successful introduction of this programme include the implementation of a mandatory reporting programme prior to the cap-and-trade programme and a consultation process involving open discussions among stakeholders for creating a consensus. Actual outcomes of the programme will take several years to assess; however, given the significant impact of growing carbon emissions from existing urban buildings, an urban cap-and-trade mechanism can be a worthwhile action at the level of local governance. Based on these lessons, other cities can consider this urban cap-and-trade scheme as a viable policy instrument.","[Nishida, Yuko] Tokyo Metropolitan Govt, Bur Environm, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1638001, Japan; [Hua, Ying] Cornell Univ, Dept Design & Environm Anal, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Nishida, Y (corresponding author), Tokyo Metropolitan Govt, Bur Environm, Shinjuku Ku, 2-8-1 Nishishinjuku, Tokyo 1638001, Japan.",yuko_nishida@post.harvard.edu; yh294@cornell.edu,,,,,,33,38,38,0,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

A novel optimization algorithm, Opposition-based Multiple Objective Differential Evolution (OMODE), is presented to solve the time-cost-quality tradeoff (TCQT) problem. This novel algorithm employs an opposition-based learning technique for population initialization and for generation jumping. Opposition numbers are used to improve the exploration and convergence performance of the optimization process. A numerical high-way construction project case study is analyzed to illustrate the use of the algorithm and demonstrate its capabilities in generating non-dominated solutions. Comparisons with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), multiple objective differential evolution (MODE) and previous results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

However, specialty contractors performing at the system level have an increasingly important role in the design and construction of healthcare and other high-performance facilities. From curtain wall assemblies to HVAC systems, specialty contractors possess the system knowledge and field expertise to support delivery of energy-efficient, cost-effective systems. Therefore, this research adapted the use of existing metrics from broader, project-level applications to a narrower building system, focused to contextualize the importance of system delivery. A comparative case study analysis was conducted to collect quantitative data on schedule and cost outcomes, construction safety, and building energy performance on two large healthcare facilities. By comparing a design-build and design-assist case, this paper demonstrates how increasing design involvement of mechanical contractors provides opportunities to reduce cost growth, schedule growth, and safety incidents, and improve the HVAC system performance in healthcare projects.

While prior research has emphasised that there is a link between the proficiency of construction companies to use BIM and the realisation of BIM benefits, little evidence exists to capture this relationship. The aim of this study is to explore the extent to which prior BIM experiences influence the perception of industry experts on potential BIM benefits. The influence of years of BIM experience on the discernment of BIM potential benefits was examined through a survey of Australian building contractors. The results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that BIM experience was a significant factor in the realisation of potential BIM benefits. The results suggest that an increase in years of BIM experience foster a better understanding of BIM benefits, which consequently can lead to a more inspiring movement towards the adoption of BIM by construction organisations. The main contribution of this article is to increase awareness towards the adoption and implementation of BIM by making a link between BIM proficiency and an increased perception of BIM potential benefits in construction organisations.","[Ahankoob, Alireza; Abbasnejad, Behzad] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Manley, Karen] Halmstad Univ, Innovat Sci Built Environm, Halmstad, Sweden","Ahankoob, A (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",Alireza.ahankoob@rmit.edu.au,,"Manley, Karen/0000-0003-1796-3244",Queensland University of Technology,The authors would like to acknowledge the support by Queensland University of Technology.,,45,11,11,5,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

This represents a shift from a focus on client-designer or designer-technology relationships to a more intelligent and independent client-technology communication. In this paper, a novel AI system called intelligent designer is proposed to understand (or learn) the client's need and expectations and generate valid designs. The design environment (i.e., the interaction between the client and the design) is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and a mathematical framework is provided for making design decisions in situations where new designs are partly random (as they are influenced by the client's feedback) and partly under the control of the computer (as they are influenced by the regulations, standards, and guidelines). The approach is demonstrated using a window design experiment.","[Karan, Ebrahim] Millersville Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Appl Engn Safety & Technol, Osburn Hall,POB 1002,40 East Frederick St, Millersville, PA 17551 USA; [Asadi, Somayeh] Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, 104 Engn Unit A, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Karan, E (corresponding author), Millersville Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Appl Engn Safety & Technol, Osburn Hall,POB 1002,40 East Frederick St, Millersville, PA 17551 USA.",Ebrahim.Karan@Millersville.edu; asadi@engr.psu.edu,,"Asadi, Somayeh/0000-0001-8868-5603; Karan, Ebrahim/0000-0002-9398-797X",,,,26,6,6,1,57,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

An investigation in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland examined two key questions: (1) the sustainability criteria that institutional real estate investors and real estate fund (REF) suppliers regard as important for the market success of S-REFs; and (2) how they assess the market acceptance of such funds. Focus groups were conducted to define sustainability components for S-REFs from a market success perspective. A questionnaire study was then undertaken to assess the two key questions. Factor analysis identified four independent sustainability factors: (1) building materials and energy; (2) expenses, return, and flexibility; (3) green space design; and (4) landscape and natural ecology. In the factor analysis, the set of criteria relating to sustainable social infrastructure did not form an independent factor. In total, 76% of the responding institutional investors decided on an S-REF investment, and 38% reported accepting return shortfalls against the REF benchmark. The market acceptance of S-REFs by institutional investors depends on cognitive drivers, institutional context, age, and family status of investors. These results can inform the design of S-REFs, marketing strategies, and sustainability ratings.","[Buegl, Robert; Leimgruber, Christian; Hueni, Guido R.; Scholz, Roland W.] ETH, Inst Environm Decis Nat & Social Sci Interface, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Leimgruber, Christian] UBS Global Asset Management, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; [Hueni, Guido R.] UBS Wealth Management & Business Banking, CH-8047 Zurich, Switzerland","Bugl, R (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Environm Decis Nat & Social Sci Interface, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",robert.buegl@env.ethz.ch; christian.leimgruber@ubs.com; guido.hueni@ubs.com; roland.scholz@env.ethz.ch,"Scholz, Roland W./B-2076-2008; Scholz, Roland/I-6534-2019; Scholz, Roland W./AAH-8385-2020","Scholz, Roland W./0000-0003-2506-3254",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [405440-107075/1],"The project 'Investors Construct Lifestyles' was funded by a grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) in its National Research Programme (NRP) 54 'Sustainable Development of the Built Environment' (Project Number 405440-107075/1).

However, the performance of supervision system varies significantly across regions. Therefore, foreign consulting firms are in desperate need of related performance benchmarking statistics to determine the niche market. A major issue is lack of a quantitative method to objectively evaluate regional supervision systems' performance. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - A new regional construction supervision system benchmarking model was developed via the principal component analysis method. This model is based on key performance indicators drawn from annual official statistics. This list of key indicators was refined by means of a focus group with selected experts. Consequently the performances of all 31 regional supervision systems were calculated and ranked. Findings - Results indicate a general gap between coastal and inland regions. The various development trends of top 10 regions are analyzed and the underlying reasons are explored. Furthermore, the regions deserving more attention or currently lacking in development are identified. The supervision industry in China is shifting from a labor-intensive industry to a knowledgeintensive industry. Originality/value - The proposed model provides a single quantitative parameter to conveniently benchmark the performance of various regions. The findings are vital for the benchmarking and clarification of future endeavor of the regional supervision systems and for foreign enterprises that are planning to enter the real-estate market in China.","[Ding, Zhikun] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Ding, Zhikun] Shenzhen Univ, Smart City Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Jian] Univ Adelaide, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Wang, Jiayuan] Coll Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zillante, George] Univ Adelaide, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Zuo, J (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",jian.zuo@adelaide.edu.au,,"Zuo, Jian/0000-0002-8279-9666","National Science Foundation for Young Scholars of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71202101]; Scientific Planning Research Grant Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of P.R.C.

An inaccurate schedule may have serious consequences such as going seriously overbudget or developing a poor public image. However, the accuracy of using traditional methods to predict a skyscraper's schedule is low because of the limitation of available information at the early stage, large uncertainties, complex influencing factors, and their coupling effects on the project schedule. To improve the accuracy of schedule estimation, this paper establishes a revised case-based reasoning (CBR) model to estimate the schedule for skyscrapers. The CBR model comprises three steps, including (1)identify seven key influencing factors, (2)retrieve and rank candidate cases according to their similarity to the target case, and (3)revise selected cases based on multiple regression analysis (MRA). The model was then tested by using 33 skyscrapers in China from the last decade. The result shows that the estimated error in this model (4.83%) is significantly lower than that in the traditional models (9-33%). This result justifies the application of extending CBR in the estimation of project schedule for megaprojects. It also provides a reliable and accurate scheduling tool to help owners better allocate and manage resources in the early stage of a megaproject.","[Li, Yongkui; Lu, Keyu] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yujie] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, Sch Design & Environm, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore","Lu, YJ (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, Sch Design & Environm, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",y.k.lee@126.com; 393495541@qq.com; luy@nus.edu.sg,"Lu, Yujie/AAF-1872-2020; Lu, Yujie/K-3003-2014","li, yongkui/0000-0001-7883-9269; Lu, Yujie/0000-0002-9585-0192","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71390523, 71471136]; National University of SingaporeNational University of Singapore [R-296-000-144-646]","This study is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71390523 and 71471136) and National University of Singapore (R-296-000-144-646).

The present study proposes an explanation for how risk allocation in a contract motivates a contractor to cooperate with a project owner. Theories of risk allocation and trust were used to motivate the research. Using a survey methodology, we collected data concerning 124 construction projects in China. We found that risk allocation influenced the contractor's role behavior through the contractor's feeling of being trusted but not the contractor's trust in the owner. Feeling of being trusted partially mediated the effect of risk allocation on the contractor's in-role (i.e., contractual) behavior and fully mediated the effect on extra-role behavior. The study introduces a social and psychological view of the impacts of risk allocation to the project and engineering management literature. We contribute to theory by arguing and demonstrating the mediating effect of trust on the relationship between risk allocation and contractor behavior. From a practical standpoint, we conclude that contractual risk allocation has a significant impact on building a trusting relationship between owners and contractors and that contractors who feel trusted perform both contractually mandated actions and actions external to the contract more diligently, resulting in the likelihood of improved outcomes for both parties.","[Xu, Zhichao] Tianjin Rail Transit Group Co Ltd, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Yin, Yilin] Tianjin Univ Technol, Construct Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Li, Dahui] Tianjin Univ Technol, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Li, Dahui] Univ Minnesota Duluth, MIS, Duluth, MN USA; [Browne, Glenn J.] Texas Tech Univ, Informat & Decis Sci, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA","Li, DH (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota Duluth, Labovitz Sch Business & Econ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",dli@d.umn.edu,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71172175, 71472135, 91646117]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant numbers 71172175, 71472135, and 91646117.",,42,8,8,2,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1042-9247,2377-0643,,ENG MANAG J,EMJ-Eng.

The model automatically generates the work breakdown structure (WBS) and precedence network respecting job logic and stores a list of construction operations typically encountered in highway projects. The generated network can subsequently be modified to suit the unique requirements of the project being considered. An object-oriented model is developed for planning highway construction operations. The model employs resource-driven scheduling in order to suit the repetitive nature of this class of projects. It accounts for (1) resource availability; (2) multiple preceding and succeeding activities; (3) transverse obstructions; (4) activities with varying quantities of work along the highway length; (5) the impact of inclement weather on crew productivity; and (6) the beneficial effect of the learning curve. At the core of the model is a relational database designed to store available resources and their respective unavailability periods. The model enables both: (1) activities executed by own force; and (2) activities subcontracted out.

To effectively manage, analyze, and revise schedules, planners need to identify when and how activities and constraints can be changed, develop various schedule alternatives, and determine the effect of changes on related activities. Existing software tools enable users to generate and visualize a schedule from a list of activities and time-based constraints, and to show multiple bars for an activity to reflect different versions of a schedule. However, there is little visual support for interacting with schedules, and for exploring and comparing alternative versions of a schedule. We present a schedule visualization tool called TASM (Tool for Advanced Schedule Management) that addresses these limitations. TASM augments traditional Gantt charts and network diagrams by directly representing constraint types, network chains, and flexibility of activity timing. We also implemented new techniques to visualize schedule differences when comparing multiple schedules. Our tests demonstrate that these techniques enhance traditional schedule visualization methods.

Strengths of the approach include the ability to readily modify construction sequences and examine their consequences using 4D CAD, and the ability to treat very large scale projects marked by significant repetition of their components. By building on a shared image of the project product model from both a design and construction perspective, the CAD model can be structured in a way that facilitates communication with the scheduling software and vice versa. Various challenges involved in making the 2-way process work are described, including consistency of product representation in the CAD and scheduling models, and the need to group CAD components at different levels of detail and locations to reflect the kinds of aggregation found in schedule representations of a project. The benefits of the approach include the ease with which different scheduling strategies can be explored and visualized, the links between 3D objects and activities can be maintained, and the completeness of the product model representations can be validated.

We examine least cost policies in a simple two-period model that focuses on bringing down the levelized cost of renewable technologies to a predefined target under two well-known dynamics: learning-by-doing (LBD) and economies of scale (EOS). We show that, when the levelized cost reduction target is stringent, subsidies are required in both periods, regardless of the dynamics. However, when the target is moderate, the optimal policy is to subsidize only in one of the two periods: under the LBD dynamics, it is optimal to subsidize as early as possible, whereas under the EOS dynamics, it is optimal to subsidize as late as possible. Under the LBD dynamics the prevailing factor is the impact of early investment on cumulative experience, whereas under the EOS dynamics the prevailing factor is capital depreciation. The key takeaway is that, based on the underlying dynamics, the policy maker needs to adopt fundamentally different kinds of policies to promote renewable technologies.","[Shrimali, Gireesh] Indian Sch Business, Dept Informat Syst, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Baker, Erin] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Shrimali, G (corresponding author), Indian Sch Business, Dept Informat Syst, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.",gireesh_shrimali@isb.edu; edbaker@ecs.umass.edu,"Baker, Erin/R-7481-2019","Baker, Erin/0000-0002-4139-9930",,,,74,17,17,0,12,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to this effect, especially from the developing economies. The purpose of this study is to address this knowledge gap through a SS-centric analysis of feasibility study reports using a stakeholder salience perspective. Design/methodology/approach Feasibility study reports for 61 projects were obtained from various government organizations in India. The SS considerations were identified in the reports using a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessments. The former was based on content analysis and the latter was conducted using VOSviewer text analysis software. Findings SS considerations related to occupational health and safety, workers' employment practices and proactive involvement of communities and end-users were found to be inadequately addressed in the reports. Based on occurrences of the SS considerations, project-affected community was found to be the most salient stakeholder, followed by the end-users and the construction workers. Statistical analysis revealed significant relationship between the SS considerations and the type of project as well as the type of project delivery system. Originality/value This study contributes to better understanding of integrating SS considerations in feasibility study of construction projects. Its results provide useful inputs to decision-makers for orienting construction projects, right from the early phases, towards benefitting the disadvantaged and weaker stakeholders irrespective of their salience attributes. In developing economies, such interventions may improve quality of lives of a large number of project stakeholders and also cultivate a positive societal image of the construction industry as a respectful, ethical and employee friendly industry.","[Goel, Ashish] Natl Inst Construct Management & Res, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Goel, Ashish; Ganesh, L.

The model employs a two-state-variable, N-stage, dynamic programming formulation, coupled with a set of heuristic rules. The model is resource-driven, and incorporates both repetitive and nonrepetitive activities in the optimization process to generate practical and near-optimal schedules. The model optimizes either project construction duration, total cost, or their combined impact for what is known as cost-plus-time bidding, also referred to as A+B bidding. The model has a number of interesting and practical features. It supports multiple crews to work simultaneously on any activity, while accounting for: (1) multiple successors and predecessors with specified lead and lag times; (2) the impact of transverse obstructions, such as rivers and creeks, on crew assignments and associated time and cost; (3) the effect of inclement weather and learning curve on crew productivity; and (4) variations in quantities of work in repetitive activities from one unit to another. The model is implemented in a prototype software that operates in Windows((R)) environment. It is developed utilizing object-oriented programming, and provides for automated data entry. Several graphical and tabular output reports can be generated. An example project, drawn from the literature, is analyzed to demonstrate the features of the developed model.","Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada","Moselhi, O (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",moselhi@cbs-engr.concordia.ca,,,,,,19,31,31,0,14,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

One long-term goal is mitigation of environmental impacts (EIs). It is proposed that by integrating environmental systems within the BIM model, the technology can act as an early warning indicator to assist stakeholders identify and evaluate EIs before they become critical to delivery. The purpose of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of BIM in identifying EIs on infrastructure projects and investigate the correlation between stakeholder competency and evaluation of EIs. Design/methodology/approach - In all, 71 informants that have relevant experience in infrastructure projects were investigated using a two-stage methodology comprising a questionnaire to determine the BIM indicators used to identify EIs and the stakeholder competencies required to assess and evaluate EIs and Behavioural Event Interviews (BEIs) to validate the competencies identified. Findings - The findings showed that risk assessments are the most critical early warning indicator in identifying EIs specifically when implemented within the cost management process. The key stakeholder competencies required to successfully evaluate EIs were identified as project organisation and building equitable relationships. BEIs showed these stakeholders to also have high levels of behavioural and contextual awareness. This suggests that, contrary to perceived perception, successful management of EIs is more dependent on collaborative working than the acquisition of technical skills. Findings also indicated that Croatian BIM stakeholders are less experienced than UK BIM stakeholders in project implementation and delivery and that less experienced BIM stakeholders require more emphasis on technical knowledge whilst the importance of soft skills is more apparent in experienced stakeholders, notably amongst the UK participants. Originality/value - The implications for infrastructure projects show that effective management of EIs can be achieved through alignment of the BIM model with the cost management plan implemented by stakeholders working collaboratively. Hence, the strategic focus for AEC companies working on infrastructure projects should be the development of staff interpersonal competencies rather than solely on project goals and/or an over-emphasis on technical skills.","[Murphy, Martina Elizabeth] Ulster Univ, Sch Built Environm, Newtownabbey, North Ireland; [Nahod, Maja-Marija] Univ Zagreb, Dept Construct Management, Zagreb, Croatia","Murphy, ME (corresponding author), Ulster Univ, Sch Built Environm, Newtownabbey, North Ireland.",m.murphy@ulster.ac.uk,"Nahod, Maja-Marija/G-2405-2015","Nahod, Maja-Marija/0000-0002-1785-3128",,,,55,5,5,1,48,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

By investigation of the previous research works, it is revealed that there is a lack of a simple and applicable framework to develop a hybrid SD-ABM simulation approach. This research proposes a hybrid SD-ABM simulation framework for modelling construction projects. The dynamics of project environment arising from the complex interrelated structure of various influencing continuous factors are taken into account using SD. The complexity of the system emerges from the interactions between different agents is also accounted by ABM. The SD and ABM simulation paradigms are finally combined. To evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid simulation framework, it is implemented in a real construction project. The safety behaviour of different working groups involved in the project is modelled using the proposed hybrid simulation framework. The influence of safety behaviour of different working groups on the project performance is finally assessed. The achieved simulation results show how the value of unsafe behaviour of different agents is varied throughout the project duration due to the interactions with other agents as well as the safety-related regulations that exist in the site.","[Nasirzadeh, Farnad] PNU, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Khanzadi, Mostafa; Mir, Mostafa] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran","Nasirzadeh, F (corresponding author), PNU, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran.",f.nasirzadeh@gmail.com,"Khanzadi, Mostafa/S-9326-2018","Nasirzadeh, Farnad/0000-0003-0101-6322",,,,45,22,22,5,53,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

Previous reviews regarding SM in construction sector are generic as their attentions have been placed on relatively small scale projects. A systematic review on SM studies in relation to MCP seems to be lacking. This paper analyzes the latest research development of this domain by reviewing selected articles published from 1997 to 2014. Four major research topics are identified: stakeholder interests and influences, stakeholder management process, stakeholder analysis methods and stakeholder engagement. This study reveals that SM approaches in MCP are subject to national context of the project, indicating a need to identify the impact of national culture on this discipline. Moreover, traditional stakeholder analysis techniques are widely adopted in MCP notwithstanding their weaknesses; therefore a social network approach for managing stakeholder interrelationships in these projects is needed.

In this paper, we present a new model for analyzing the sustainability of infrastructure project alternatives from a stakeholder-centric perspective: the stakeholder-sensitive, social welfare-oriented sustainability benefit analysis model (S-3 Model). The model evaluates infrastructure project alternatives based on a proposed sustainable construction social welfare function (SC-SWF). The SC-SWF is a measure of the collective social, environmental, and economic benefits to all stakeholders. It can help identify project solutions that offer social (group) welfare based on the social, environmental, and economic benefits to individual stakeholders. The theoretical foundation of the proposed SC-SWF is grounded in the areas of social choice theory and social welfare theory. The proposed model and its practical application are illustrated through a hypothetical case study. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by advancing the knowledge in the area of social welfare theory and the fundamental research in infrastructure system decision theory. The proposed analysis may guide infrastructure system decision making and may lead to better understanding of how to plan and design infrastructure systems in a way that maximizes the collective social, environmental, and economic benefits to stakeholders.

Design/methodology/approach A review of the literature highlighted a lack of comprehensive research to evaluate CDWM performance of key project stakeholders, like owners, contractors and consultants. After the identification of 22 performance variables through a pilot study, a first questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the views of respondents toward CDWM performance. The 132 responses were analyzed using factor analysis to determine specific CDWM performance factors, which formed a conceptual performance evaluation framework of CDWM. Furthermore, a practical index (PI) was proposed to integrate the feasibility and effectiveness of CDWM strategies. The values of PI were employed to prioritize CDWM strategies from data collected in a second questionnaire survey. Findings The validated results from factor analysis revealed that the conceptual performance evaluation framework of CDWM consists of six factors; and the attitude toward CDWM emerged as the foremost critical factor. The prioritization of PI values indicated that raising CDWM awareness among construction stakeholders was the most feasible and effective strategy for CDWM. Originality/value This CDWM performance evaluation framework is one of the first to holistically evaluate CDWM from key stakeholder perspectives. In addition, the PI firstly enables quantitative integration of the feasibility and effectiveness of CDWM strategies.","[Kim, Soo Yong] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Busan, South Korea; [Nguyen, Minh, V] Pukyong Natl Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Construct Management, Busan, South Korea; [Van Truong Luu] Ho Chi Minh City Open Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Nguyen, MV (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Construct Management, Busan, South Korea.",minhnguyenacademic@gmail.com,"Nguyen, Minh V./AAY-4206-2020","Nguyen, Minh V./0000-0003-3278-8608",Pukyong National University Research Abroad Fund [C-D-2017-0972],The authors would like to express their gratitude to all the survey participants for their great support in data collection and the four anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and invaluable contributions.

Often simplified as an act of corporate social responsibility, the complexity of the engagement concept means its processes and consequences evade closer scrutiny and analysis. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of stakeholder engagement to reveal its theoretical and practical complexity; two complimentary models of stakeholder engagement are mobilized to analyze empirical data from a hospital case-study project. The result is a retheorization of stakeholder engagement as a complex entwined process of responsibility, organizational action, and work package requirements where stakeholder engagement and agency (i.e., ethical treatment of stakeholders) are understood as separate variables that result in shifts among responsible, paternalistic, neoclassic, and strategic behaviors. The contribution lies in a more sophisticated understanding of stakeholder engagement being attained: shifts between stakeholder engagement and agency define relations between parties in corporate social responsibility (CSR) terms; the ethical aspirations of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) organizations are impacted by daily project activities; and the unique characteristics of stakeholder engagement in construction (e.g., binding of party interests, effect of subcontractor entry, and collective blame/praise) are brought into focus. Resulting recommendations include periodic review of engagement activity to ensure the CSR strategic objectives of organizations are aligned to stakeholder engagement work.","[Collinge, William] Univ Manchester, Construct Project Management, Dept Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, E8 Pariser Bldg,76 Sackville St, Manchester M1 7JR, Lancs, England","Collinge, W (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Construct Project Management, Dept Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, E8 Pariser Bldg,76 Sackville St, Manchester M1 7JR, Lancs, England.",william.collinge@manchester.ac.uk,"Collinge, William/AAC-4927-2021","Collinge, William/0000-0003-3387-1649",,,,39,7,7,12,69,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

J,"Zarghami, SA; Dumrak, J",,,,"Zarghami, Seyed Ashkan; Dumrak, Jantanee",,,Reimaging stakeholder analysis in project management: network theory and fuzzy logic applications,ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,Centrality analysis; Fuzzy inference system; Project stakeholder analysis; Stakeholder salience; Stakeholder theory,SOCIAL NETWORK; PERCEPTIONS; GOVERNANCE; DYNAMICS; MODEL,"Purpose The methods presently used for project stakeholder analysis have typically followed two distinct patterns: (1) a project-centric approach that places a project at the center, and subsequently, concentrates on dyadic relationships between the project and its stakeholders; (2) a network theory-based approach that emphasizes on the interconnections within the network of project stakeholders. The main contention of this study is built upon the premise that neither the sole analysis of dyadic relationships between a project and its stakeholders nor the stand-alone use of the network theory methods is adequate for reliable analysis of stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach This article proposes a model that bases the salience of stakeholders on their relationships with the project as well as on their interdependencies in the project. In doing so, this work explores the potential of a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to provide a comprehensive picture of stakeholder analysis. Using a real-world biodiversity project, this paper analyses the project stakeholders based on their possession of various attributes as well as the extent to which each individual stakeholder influences the entire connected network of all stakeholders. Findings A salient feature of the proposed FIS model is its ability to provide a high capacity for analyzing the results. The model is able to generate the input-output relationship surface view for stakeholder analysis. Further, unlike the traditional project stakeholder analysis methods that are linear, the proposed model is strongly nonlinear. This implies that change in the input variables of the fuzzy-based model is not expected to lead to a proportional change in the model output. Practical implications Two practical implications can be drawn from the presented stakeholder analysis model. First, confronted with mounting pressure to understand the stakeholder environment and to effectively manage stakeholders, project managers need to establish a sound stakeholder management strategy. The stakeholder analysis model developed herein casts a wider net for the critical ranking of stakeholders in a project, thereby providing a more accurate prioritization of the stakeholders. Second, while stakeholders independently require managerial attention, understanding the effect of competing and cooperative stakeholder interactions are unarguably of great importance. The presented model prompts the project managers to recognize not only the influence of key stakeholders on the project but also the interactions of multiple stakeholders within the stakeholder network. Originality/value The proposed stakeholder analysis model possesses several desirable features. First, it is not constrained to capturing only stakeholder attributes discussed in the example project provided in this study. The model is flexible and adaptable to all business and management contexts. Second, the stakeholder mapping in the model is not a function of a sole attribute but rather a cumulative effect of multiple stakeholder attributes. In fact, the power of the suggested model lies in its ability to incorporate the three aspects of stakeholder theory into a single model. Third, the presented model builds a quantitative and qualitative picture of the stakeholder salience. The suggested FIS model is capable of processing both qualitative perception of stakeholder attributes and quantitative analysis of the network of stakeholder interactions. This allows for a more comprehensive and synergistic utilization of model inputs.","[Zarghami, Seyed Ashkan; Dumrak, Jantanee] Torrens Univ, Global Project Management, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Zarghami, SA (corresponding author), Torrens Univ, Global Project Management, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",ashkan.zarghami@laureate.edu.au; jdumrak@laureate.net.au,,"Zarghami, Ashkan/0000-0001-7839-2794; Dumrak, Jantanee/0000-0002-5559-4059",,,,63,2,2,2,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

The authors conducted interviews among experts to localize a framework of prequalification criteria. Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), accompanied by a survey among industry participants, was used to determine the importance level of decision criteria. The results confirmed that the existing guidelines cannot meet the expectations of the industry due to the overemphasis on the past performance of consultants and disregarding their current capabilities. For the international audience, this study clarifies that (1)the working culture of industry participants impacts their judgments on the importance level of intangible and tangible criteria used for prequalification processes, (2)short-listing consultants for long-term and fragmented data collection in national registration or project prequalification should be avoided, and (3)researchers must test FAHP models with different fuzzy scales because the success of the widely used fuzzy extent analysis method is highly dependent on the scale of fuzzy functions and judgments of decision makers.","[Nazari, Ahad] Shahid Beheshti Univ, IPMA, Univ Sq, Tehran 1983969411, Iran; [Nazari, Ahad] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Architecture & Urban Design, Univ Sq, Tehran 1983969411, Iran; [Vandadian, Shaghayegh] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Architecture & Urban Design, Dept Construct, Univ Sq, Tehran 1983969411, Iran; [Abdirad, Hamid] Univ Washington, Coll Built Environm, 3949 15th Ave NE 224 Gould Hall,Box 355740, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Abdirad, H (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Coll Built Environm, 3949 15th Ave NE 224 Gould Hall,Box 355740, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",a_nazari@sbu.ac.ir; habdirad@uw.edu,,"NAZARI, AHAD/0000-0002-7031-1280; Abdirad, Hamid/0000-0002-9295-4113",,,,74,7,7,0,29,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

As an approach to multi-criteria decision-making, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is explored to determine whether the traditional AHP (consistency ratio 0.1) and the weakly consistent AHP (consistency ratio 0.5-0.1), currently used for contractor selection, produce the same result. A case study comparing both methods reveals that the top-ranked contractor was the same while the ranking of the remaining contractors were different. Because choosing the right contractor can mean the difference between project success and failure, the consistency rule for the traditional AHP should be used for contractor selection, and not the weakly consistent AHP, especially as inconsistency increases random outcomes. This finding becomes important if the first-choice contractor opts out of a contract or is terminated by the client and a suitable second choice must be made from the original bids.","[Martin, Hector] Univ West Indies, Construct Management, St Augustine Circular Rd, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Koylass, Joey] Univ West Indies, St Augustine Circular Rd, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Welch, Ferida] St Charles Tunapuna Girls RC, Eastern Main Rd, Tunapuna, Trinidad Tobago","Martin, H (corresponding author), Univ West Indies, Construct Management, St Augustine Circular Rd, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",hector.martin@sta.uwi.edu,,,,,,49,9,9,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

Based on a Venn-diagram analysis of data, we suggest a clear and nonoverlapping SSAs framework to be used in construction projects. We also propose a project stakeholder typology model based on SSAs. The results indicated that PSTM divides stakeholders into 15 different types based on four attributes, namely Potency, Legitimacy, Urgency, and Proximity.

However, it is not easy to take the needs and wishes of stakeholders into account while balancing their diverse power and interests in the engagement process. The unbalanced distribution of power and interests inevitably causes conflict during engagement with multiple stakeholders. Research on how to improve PE performance from a stakeholder's perspective is still in its infancy. This study used a survey to investigate the complicated relationships between stakeholder's power, interests, conflict, and project satisfaction. The results showed that different forms of power and interest influenced final satisfaction with PE projects either directly or indirectly, through conflict. The PE organizers are encouraged to include more representatives from different groups of stakeholders in the team decision-making process to enable active engagement with their interests and to establish a systematic and logical team-decision-making process to decrease task conflict. The findings of this study will contribute to balancing stakeholder's power and interests, managing conflict effectively, improving PE performance for construction development projects, and, finally, to maximizing public value.","[Leung, Mei-yung; Yu, Jingyu; Liang, Qi] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Leung, MY (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bcmei@cityu.edu.hk; jingyuyu-c@my.cityu.edu.hk; qiliang3-c@student.cityu.edu.hk,"Leung, Mei-yung/K-4075-2015","Leung, Mei-yung/0000-0003-4186-2347",Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors (Planning and Development Division) [NP022075-02],"The work described in this paper was fully supported by a grant from the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors (Planning and Development Division, Project No. NP022075-02).",,80,27,27,8,70,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

This limitation explains the reluctance of contractors to undergo interviews. Existing research (outside bid/no-bid and margin decision factor identification and subsequent decision modeling development) only begins to provide insights into key tendering stages, particularly around risk assessments and corporate review processes. Early research suggested one to three review stages. However, when considering the whole work procurement process from prospect identification to contract execution, five to seven series of reviews can be arguably applied by some contractors, wherein some reviews stepped through several layers of internal senior management. Tendering processes were presented as flowchart models that traditionally follow hard system (rectangular shapes and straight line arrows) steps, which suggest that a precise process also leads to precise results. However, given that contractors do not win every tender they submit, the process is less precise than that suggested in rigidly structured flowcharts. Twenty-five detailed semi-structured interviews were held with purposely selected high-profile publicly and privately owned construction companies in Australia with significantly varied turnovers. Analyses show that contractors are concerned about the negative effects of increasing corporate governance demands, with many stating that people involved are the most critical element to tendering success. A new way of presenting the ITP of contractors is assessed using a soft systems methodology (SSM) approach. SSM offers an alternative way of considering human interaction challenges within the ITP of contractors, which needs to be tested with the industry. The format graphics of SSM guidelines are presented as a way of offering contractors a different approach, which may assist individuals who are looking to re-structure their tendering activities in a more humanistic and less rigid procedural approach.","[Urquhart, Stephen; Whyte, Andrew] Curtin Univ, Sch Civil & Mech Engn, Kent St, Perth, WA 6102, Australia","Urquhart, S (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Civil & Mech Engn, Kent St, Perth, WA 6102, Australia.",stephen.urquhart@postgrad.curtin.edu.au,,,"Australian Government Research Training Program ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science",The authors acknowledge the contribution of an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.

Design buffers involve building slack into a proven systems architecture to absorb foreseeable change requests. Choosing the appropriate amounts of reuse and slack is dependent on the uncertainty in the manufacturing technology over the infrastructure life cycle. While proven infrastructure designs can economically accommodate incremental changes in technology, adaptation costs escalate when sufficient buffers are not built-in and changes are radical. We uncover opposing stakeholder interests in determining the extent to which reuse or buffers are used. Design reuse is attractive to the client to reduce the risk that a facility fails to perform, but limits the designer's job to tedious customization work. Design buffers are attractive to the designer to do original problem-solving and limit the risks of being unresponsive to uncertainty, but not to the client who is not guaranteed that the investments will pay off. We find that inequalities between the two stakeholders in the governing power on design decision-making compound the difficulties in assessing and implementing the reuse versus buffers tradeoff.","Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Gil, N (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",nuno.gil@mbs.ac.uk; beckman@haas.berkeley.edu,,"Gil, Nuno A./0000-0001-6338-2913",,,,70,11,11,0,15,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Only through active participation of product champions at all levels of the organization can productive innovation take place: top managers as the chief executive product champions, midlevel managers as the business innovation product champions, and employees at all levels as the technical innovation product champions.",,"Winistorfer, SG (corresponding author), US FOREST SERV,FOREST PROD LAB,USDA,1 GIFFORD PINCHOT DR,MADISON,WI 53705, USA.",,,,,,,30,3,3,0,4,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENG,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398",0742-597X,,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

It questions whether governments should fund research and development in construction, and if so, what level and types of support might be appropriate to meet emerging needs. It addresses this with reference to the current debate on the public funding of science, citing Kealey and Pavitt. The author considers specific construction-related issues and changing conditions, indicating the need for more, rather than less funding by both private and public sectors. In conclusion, the author develops a third way, different from Kealey's and Pavitt's approaches. Construction requires a strong and vibrant research base, partly funded by government. Simultaneously, the state requires a research and knowledge base in order to fulfil its roles such as for governance of technologies in the built environment.

Most relevant studies have developed models that predicted the probability of business failure within 1 year using financial ratios. Although a few studies have attempted to use nonfinancial information, they did not provide empirical evidence that this addition can improve the prediction performance of a model. To address these problems, this study proposed a model that used not only accounting variables but also construction market and macroeconomic variables to predict failure probability from 1 to 3 years. We examined the effects of combinations of these variables on the business failure prediction performance of construction contractors in the United States and compared the effects of combinations of these variables between three models that predict business failure within 1, 2, and 3 years. This study developed a prediction model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), which is a deep-learning algorithm. The results showed that the prediction model using both the construction market and macroeconomic variables had approximately 2%, 3%, and 4% higher prediction performance compared with that using only accounting variables when predicting within 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. This means that the business failure prediction model had superior prediction performance from a long-term perspective when the construction market and macroeconomic variables were used in addition to accounting variables. The results of this study are expected to provide empirical evidence regarding the effect of input variable selection on the prediction performance for each prediction period and useful references for improving performance of predicting business failure of construction contractors.","[Jang, Youjin; Jeong, Inbae; Cho, Yong K.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Cho, YK (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",uzjang@gatech.edu; inbae.jeong@gatech.edu; yong.cho@ce.gatech.edu,"Jeong, Inbae/AAN-6730-2021","Jeong, Inbae/0000-0002-8316-1445; Cho, Yong/0000-0002-3677-8899",,,,45,8,8,3,45,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

As a response to the excessive uncertainty, standard contracts for construction projects demand that contractors indemnify all works associated with a project and the people involved in it through having insurance cover. Even though the consensus that insurance as a primary means of managing risk has expanded significantly, few contractors have adopted it in developing countries. This study set out to evaluate the factors influencing insurance use as a risk response tool for contractors alongside its efficiency in the construction industry. Quantitative research method was adopted to achieve the aim of the study in which a close-ended questionnaire was developed. Respondents were chosen using a purposive sampling technique and they include Architects, Construction Managers, Project Managers, Quantity Surveyors, Engineers and Insurance professionals within Gauteng province. Retrieved data was analysed using descriptive statistics, One-Sample T-test, and exploratory factor analysis. Findings revealed that factors influencing insurance use as risk response tool by contractors can be categorised into project characteristics, financial stability influence, organisational objective influence, insurer's influence, and insured participants and legal requirement influence. It was also established that insurance is efficient in managing external risks. Based on these findings, it was concluded that project characteristics play a major role in the decision to employ insurance as a tool for managing risk. It was recommended that construction team players and stakeholders should encourage the use of the different insurance covers for construction projects.","[Akinradewo, Opeoluwa; Aghimien, Douglas; Aigbavboa, Clinton] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, SARChl Sustainable Construct Management & Leaders, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Onyia, Michael] Univ Nigeria, Dept Civil Engn, Nsukka, Nigeria","Akinradewo, O (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, SARChl Sustainable Construct Management & Leaders, Johannesburg, South Africa.",opeakinradewo@gmail.com,"Akinradewo, Opeoluwa/Q-7974-2018; Aghimien, Douglas Omoregie/H-4534-2018","Akinradewo, Opeoluwa/0000-0002-4462-0960; Aghimien, Douglas Omoregie/0000-0002-6661-5679",,,,42,2,2,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

In the traditional single criterion bidding method, the markup decision has a significant impact on a contractor's business success. Contractors usually take into consideration several factors in the process of determining their markup. This study has reviewed the literature and identified a range of contractors' behaviors when making their markup decision within a competitive bidding environment. An additive markup function consisting of three components, namely competition, risk, and need for work, was developed in order to replicate markup behaviors of contractors. Then, agent-based modeling has been employed for simulating the bidding process within a market formed of a set of heterogeneous contractors with different risk attitudes and defined markup behaviors. This model was used to study the impact of considering need for work and risk allowance in markup determination on financial performance of contractors in various market scenarios. Results suggest that the optimal policy is moderation in both dimensions of risk attitude and need for work. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, evaluating financial status and predicting business failures of construction companies are crucial for owners, general contractors, investors, banks, insurance firms, and creditors. The prediction results can be used to select qualified contractors capable of accomplishing the projects. In this study, a hybrid fuzzy instance-based classifier for contractor default prediction (FICDP) is proposed. The new approach is constructed by incorporating the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor classifier (FKNC), the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), and the firefly algorithm (FA). In this hybrid paradigm, the FKNC is utilized to classify the contractors into two groups (default and nondefault) based on their past financial performances. Since the nondefault samples dominate the historical database, the SMOTE algorithm is employed to create synthetic samples of the minority class and therefore alleviates the between-class imbalance problem. Moreover, the FA is employed to determine an appropriate set of model parameters. Experimental results have shown that the proposed FICDP can outperform other benchmark methods.","[Cheng, Min-Yuan] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Taipei 10608, Taiwan; [Nhat-Duc Hoang] Duy Tan Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Inst Res & Dev, Danang 550000, Vietnam","Cheng, MY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.",myc@mail.ntust.edu.tw; hoangnhatduc@dtu.edu.vn,"Hoang, Nhat Duc/AAD-8621-2019",,,,,57,18,18,5,34,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Research emphasizes that contractor capability and risk management are critical for project success and have a correlation. However, observations suggest that risks are not considered during prequalification and even prequalified contractors perform poorly causing project failures. Such observations indicate a research gap for which this research explores the role of contractor capability in risk management at the project level. The analysis uses a comparative case study of risk management in two similar ongoing projects having different contractors. It reveals that the contractor capability assessed during prequalification is an attribute of an organization; while the capability required to mitigate risks and execute work is an attribute of a project. When risks materialize, the capability of a contractor may reduce and the capability required to mitigate risks in a project may increase. This will create a deficit of resources resulting in poor performance by the contractor. Therefore, criteria for prequalification must be decided considering risks scenarios for projects and contractors to screen out marginally qualified contractors and increase chances of project success.","[Iyer, K.

Because it is currently unclear how performance-based payments in network tenders can effectively encourage network members to coordinate their own operations, a serious game was performed that simulates road maintenance planning to study changes in decision making and the emergence of network coordination. The experiments show that monetary incentives influence decision making, but their effect may be opposite to their intended aim and can lead to a competitive network. It was, however, also found that this competitiveness is not shown in networks where members are familiar with each other. This leads to the conclusion that penalty-based incentive mechanisms probably interfere with self-regulation and that the social dimension of contractor collaboration is paramount to the success of network-based contracting of construction activities.","[Scharpff, Joris; Spaan, Matthijs T.

Thus monitoring workers' psychological status may benefit the reduction of unsafe behaviors on site, thus preventing accident from occurring. However, due to the lack of appropriate methods to collect jobsite workers' psychological data, it is difficult for the existing research to reveal the relationship between psychological status and unsafe behavior. This research proposes an efficient wearable technology-based method to collect jobsite workers' psychological data to support such an analysis. Wearable-device-based physical data collection has been regarded as a promising approach to study human's psychological status in the field of psychology, and applied to pedagogy and clinical psychology, but seldom in the construction industry. The purpose of this research is to study the availability of the approach in construction safety management. To do this, an on-site experiment was conducted to collect workers' physical data via using wearable devices, as well as psychological data through the use of PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) and DRM (Day Reconstruction Method). Based on the data, the correlations between workers' psychological status and physical data are analyzed. The results show that jobsite workers' physical data is available for the measurement of workers' psychological status. This research will contribute to the research on jobsite workers' psychology in the context of real construction sites, as well as the identification of the mental causes of workers' unsafe behaviors on site, thus improving the performance of construction safety management.","[Guo, Hongling; Yu, Yantao; Xiang, Tian] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Heng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Dan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Psychol, Beijing, Peoples R China","Guo, HL (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hlguo@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Li, Heng/B-2821-2015; Zhang, Dan/N-2512-2013; Yu, Yantao/S-6035-2018","Li, Heng/0000-0002-3187-9041; Yu, Yantao/0000-0003-0400-3068","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51208282, 51578318]; Tsinghua-Glodon BIM Research Center",We would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 51208282 and 51578318) as well as Tsinghua-Glodon BIM Research Center for supporting this research.,,44,33,36,3,89,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

The decline in elderly ability increases their dependence on the quality of facilities provided by their residential apartment. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to develop an integrated indoor built environment-quality of life model for the elderly in P&S housing estates. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey, including scales for 4 quality of life (QoL) domains (physical health, psychological health, social relationships and overall QoL), and 13 indoor built environment (BE) components were identified. In total, 365 survey data were collected from the elderly in 18 political districts of Hong Kong, while reliability analysis, multiple regression analysis and structural equation modeling were adopted in the data analysis. Findings Based on the congruence of results of these statistical analyses, it was revealed that: furniture and fixtures predict all the four QoL domains of the elderly; lighting and color induce social relationships; and overall QoL is predicted by distance and handrails. Originality/value Several recommendations were made in accordance with the research results, such as review minimum spacing requirements to provide walking distance for elderly physical activity, investigate the micro-climate for appropriate building orientation, consider the changing body size of the elderly for supply of furniture, use warm colors with high levels of illumination, and so on.","[Leung, Mei-yung; Famakin, Ibukun Oluwadara] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chendi] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Coll Sci & Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Leung, MY (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bcmei@cityu.edu.hk,"Wang, Chendi/Y-9699-2018; Leung, Mei-yung/K-4075-2015","Wang, Chendi/0000-0001-7955-1355; Leung, Mei-yung/0000-0003-4186-2347; Famakin, Ibukun/0000-0002-4652-5713","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, ChinaHong Kong Research Grants Council [CityU 114512]","The work described in this paper was fully supported by a grant from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Project No. CityU 114512).",,91,5,5,7,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Relatively few studies have considered the processes through which safety climates develop within subcontracted workgroups. This study sought to examine the relationship between intragroup communication relating to WHS and the workgroup safety climate. Data were collected from 39 subcontracted workgroups in the Australian construction industry using social network analysis to examine worker-to-worker, supervisor-to-worker, and worker-to-supervisor patterns of WHS-related communication. The relationship between group social network metrics and group safety climate were examined. Network density was a predictor of the workgroup safety climate. Furthermore, a suppressor effect was found such that WHS-related communication between group members and the group supervisor increased the variance in group safety climate explained in a regression model. The results highlight the importance of intragroup communication in creating a shared understanding about the priority placed on WHS within subcontracted construction workgroups. In using subcontracted workgroups as the unit of analysis and linking within-group communication patterns to the workgroup safety climate, the research makes an original contribution to knowledge in empirically demonstrating the safety benefits associated with fostering a dense communication network and encouraging frequent supervisor-worker communication in subcontracted workgroups.","[Lingard, Helen; Pirzadeh, Payam; Oswald, David] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia","Lingard, H (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",helen.lingard@rmit.edu.au,"Pirzadeh, Payam/AAM-9514-2021","Pirzadeh, Payam/0000-0001-6511-0946; Lingard, Helen/0000-0003-3645-8390; Oswald, David/0000-0002-3013-5681",Lendlease,This research was funded by Lendlease.,,73,16,16,5,35,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

This empirical study of 197 project portfolios investigates the effect of the intensity of engagement (IoE) of portfolio-internal stakeholders on project portfolio success. We show that the effect of stakeholders is phase-specific and that role clarity as a measure of PPM maturity affects the nature of the relationship between the IoE of stakeholders and portfolio success. The effects of the IoE of senior managers on success are not clearly positive with regard to strategic portfolio structuring and are even negative in operative portfolio steering in established PPM systems. In immature PPM systems, line managers tend to take advantage of their position in resource management. Surprisingly, the influence of portfolio managers in portfolio steering is insignificant. Altogether, this paper shows the diverse effect of the IoE of stakeholders on portfolio success. This study enriches project research by applying stakeholder theory to the project portfolio context and offers practical guidance for further professionalizing PPM. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The project managers found several challenges in using the guidelines. Especially, the guidelines lack clarity regarding (a) how to identify stakeholders and determine their importance and (b) how to reveal stakeholders' expectations. Further, the application revealed that the project manager may not have the skills or the resources required to carry out the tasks involved in making the necessary inquiries. Therefore, the stakeholder analysis may be based on superficial rather than deep knowledge. It seems that the current guidelines should be considered as a conceptual framework rather than instructions on how to do a real world stakeholder analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

However, dynamic stakeholder opinions and value maximization perceptions result in conflicting requirements that hinder the adoption of truly sustainable retrofit decision. This paper uses an agent-based model to understand how social network interactions can help stakeholders with different characteristics prioritize their values on cost awareness, energy saving, and organizational performance to ultimately come up with an optimal retrofit decision for a commercial office building. Experimental analysis is used to qualitatively validate the model against results from other studies in literature. The results indicate that highly connected network structures can facilitate the interaction between the stakeholders to achieve alignment. In addition, networks with highly confident stakeholders typically hinder agreement, whereas those with stakeholders that have similar perceptions of values and moderate confidence levels can significantly facilitate alignment and polarization of stakeholders towards a unified retrofit objective.

A fuzzy similarity consensus (FSC) model was developed to aggregate experts' opinions on roles and responsibilities in the owner managing contractor (OMC) project delivery system. The FSC model categorized 324 generic OMC tasks into three responsibility task lists: owner, contractor, and shared. In a consensus-reaching process, the FPRC approach is applied to shared tasks, where expert opinions on responsibility conflict are expressed, to achieve an aggregated responsibility decision for each task. Experts compare the three responsibility alternatives in pairs by using linguistic preferences, defined on a fuzzy preference scale, to select a preferred responsibility alternative for each of the conflicting tasks. A computed linguistic consensus degree guides the experts on their level of consensus in every round of the process. The quality of experts is defined with a fuzzy expert system-determined importance weight factor for each expert. The FPRC approach is relevant to the construction industry, as it incorporates consistency in decision making by allowing experts to measure and reach an adequate level of consensus linguistically when deciding on responsibilities. The proposed approach provides a method of reducing conflicts in the assignment of task responsibility between the owner and its contractors as early as the project initiation phase; thus, the project teams can concentrate on the work to be done rather than deal with responsibility conflicts during project execution.

This paper, therefore, presents a framework with novel visuals and enhanced schedule computations that can generate shortest feasible schedules that address the key constraints of deadlines, limited resources, and nonidentical units. On the visual side, the framework integrates the LOB and Flowline visuals to enhance schedule legibility. On the computational side, it presents a novel three-step procedure to guarantee the shortest feasible schedules: (1) critical path method-line of balance (CPM-LOB) formulation of the number of parallel crews needed to meet deadlines; (2) interruption-time formulation to reduce schedule delay under crew limits; and (3) first-come first-served multicrew assignment process to reduce the schedule time-gaps and delays under nonidentical units. Manually-solved examples are used to demonstrate the power and streamlined applicability of the proposed framework.

While several research efforts have analyzed the causes and effects of rework and provided guidelines to reduce rework, almost no research exists to analyze the impact of rework timing and quantity on schedule delays and to support decisions on cost effective recovery. This research presents a quantitative mechanism for schedule analysis considering rework. The mechanism has three aspects: (1) a new schedule representation of rework magnitude as negative percentage complete for affected activities, documented on the specific date on which the rework is detected; (2) a modified daily-windows delay analysis to apportion project delays among the responsible parties; and (3) an optimization technique for determining the least costly corrective action strategy that recovers project delays. The proposed approach is applied to a case study to demonstrate its ability to consider rework impact, in combination with other progress events by other project parties.

To address this insufficiency this paper proposes a new schedule analysis technique called FLORA that simultaneously captures the dynamics of float, logic, and resource allocation in its analyses. FLORA analyzes not only the direct impact of a delay but also its secondary effect. The analysis process follows ten rules that are flexible and customizable. A case study is employed to illustrate its application. FLORA yields different and more reasonable outcomes compared to the window analysis technique. Each single analysis may also yield different or even conflicting results. By properly dealing with the current issues of schedule analysis, FLORA can be more reliable. Practitioners may readily accept its analyses and outcomes because they are able to specify, modify, and consent to the rules for schedule analysis to fit into a specific context in advance. Researchers may further evaluate the impacts of different factors on delay responsibility or apply FLORA to real projects to assess its strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.","[Nguyen, Long D.] Jax Kneppers Associates Inc, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Ibbs, William] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Ibbs, W (corresponding author), Ibbs Consulting Grp Inc, 5932 Contra Costa Rd, Oakland, CA 94618 USA.",long@jaxkneppers.com; drcwibbs@aol.com,,,,,,32,15,15,0,2,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

However, this growth is accompanied by an inevitable increase in claims and disputes, which consequently leads to significant delays and additional costs to the project. Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods are often used to address these conflicts, but different issues and backgrounds of stakeholders in the ME affect which ADR is used if any. In light of this, the main aim of this study is to explore dispute causes and resolution practices in the ME as perceived by the different stakeholders involved. Based on extensive literature review, a comprehensive questionnaire survey was conducted involving 177 professionals from different sectors of the ME construction industry. The responses were analyzed from three distinct perspectives, namely contractors, owners, and claim advisors. Findings revealed that contractual causes are the most common disputes in the ME region, and traditional resolution methods are continually practiced despite the recognized need for new alternatives. This research provides professionals in Middle Eastern and foreign countries with invaluable insights into construction claims' types and dispute resolution (DR) systems in the region. Moreover, it allows the various construction stakeholders to understand and take into consideration the perceptions of others when applying risk and dispute prevention techniques.","[Awwad, Rita; Barakat, Boushra] Lebanese Amer Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 211 E 46th St, New York, NY 10017 USA; [Menassa, Carol] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2350 Hayward St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Awwad, R (corresponding author), Lebanese Amer Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 211 E 46th St, New York, NY 10017 USA.",rita.awwad@lau.edu.lb; boushra.barakat@lau.edu; menassa@umich.edu,"Awwad, Rita/AAJ-3205-2020","Awwad, Rita/0000-0001-9963-0202",,,,33,23,23,2,30,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

We conduct a multi-site ethnography at one of the biggest contemporary cross-border transport megaprojects in the world - the Danish/German Fehmarnbelt Fixed Link. Tying together three streams of the legitimacy literature in a new analytical approach, we suggest three dimensions of project legitimacy perception: trust, majority, and morality. In doing so, we provide a new integrative model of legitimacy perception in megaprojects. We illustrate how these legitimacy dimensions dynamically interact. We thus provide new insights on how project legitimacy is continuously renegotiated in megaprojects with implications for future developments of project governance.","[Witz, Petr; Stingl, Verena; Wied, Morten; Oehmen, Josef] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, Lyngby, Denmark; [Witz, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Publ & Social Policy, Fac Social Sci, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic; [Stingl, Verena] Aalborg Univ, Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Mat & Prod, Aalborg, Denmark","Witz, P (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Publ & Social Policy, Fac Social Sci, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic.",petr.witz@fsv.cuni.cz,"Witz, Petr/AAH-7647-2020","Oehmen, Josef/0000-0001-5889-4586; Stingl, Verena/0000-0001-7128-4467",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skodowska-Curie grant [713683]; Charles University [Progres Q18],This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie SkodowskaCurie grant agreement No 713683.

Through this research, we continue to progress toward a new 4D-based collective decision device, so these elements will contribute to propose 4D BIM as DM support on architecture engineering construction (AEC) projects. Further, the present research will be complemented by results from questionnaires given at a later research stage. The article presents a brief review of BIM context to consider ways of fostering the implementation of all 4D BIM uses (not only visualization).

Nonetheless, neglecting one of the sustainable pillars in construction, especially social sustainability, can lead to issues such as poor security and health. Previous studies on social sustainability in construction were mostly conducted in isolated contexts, where inadequate attention was placed on stakeholders' responsibility throughout project life cycle. Therefore, this study aims to establish the social sustainability attributes in construction, subsequently relating this concept to two key aspects of construction: project life cycle and stakeholder involvement. This systematic literature review-based study has established nine main attributes with 20 sub-attributes, where Health and Safety was found to be the most dominant attribute, whilst Human Rights is the least acclaimed attribute for social sustainability. Further, the mapping of social attributes against the varying degrees of stakeholder involvement at different phases of project life cycle provides a definable understanding of social sustainability in construction, through the three elements of attributes, stakeholders, and project life cycle. The mapping would enable project clients to prioritise the selection of social sustainability attributes (what/how), relevant to their projects by engaging with relevant stakeholders (who) throughout construction project life cycle (when).","[Kordi, Nurul Elma; Belayutham, Sheila; Ibrahim, Che Khairil Izam Che] Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Coll Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia","Kordi, NE (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Coll Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia.",elma8207@uitm.edu.my,"Belayutham, Sheila/AAZ-3012-2021; Kordi, Nurul Elma/AAP-9218-2020","Belayutham, Sheila/0000-0003-2009-2603; Che Ibrahim, Che Khairil Izam/0000-0002-7728-3702",Universiti Teknologi MARA [600-RMC/GPK 5/3 (220/2020)],The authors are grateful to the Universiti Teknologi MARA (Project 600-RMC/GPK 5/3 (220/2020)).,,112,0,0,6,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Although some authors have recommended the use of specific heuristics over any other rule, these recommendations are general and do not encompass all possible project characteristics in terms of resources and network topology. Without a guidance system, schedulers must try several combinations of rules until they find one that compares favorably (shortest duration) with the results of the other priority rules. This study proposes a new tiebreaker (priority number) that enhances the performance of an existing heuristic and classifies the heuristics' performance based on specific project characteristics. The results show that, as a tiebreaker of the late finish rule, the priority number leads to obtain schedules with lower deviations from the critical path method (CPM) duration and a higher number of shortest schedules than with traditional tiebreakers. The proposed classification system indicates the two heuristics with the best performance for specific resource network characteristics. This classification will help practitioners to decide which heuristic applies when mitigating the resource supply-demand problem given the project characteristics.","[Franco-Duran, Diana M.] Virginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 750 Drillfield Dr,200 Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [de la Garza, Jesus M.] Clemson Univ, Glenn Dept Civil Engn, 121 Lowry Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA","Franco-Duran, DM (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 750 Drillfield Dr,200 Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",dianitaf@vt.edu; jdelaga@clemson.edu,,,,,,19,3,3,2,10,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The quality of schedules has been a research topic only for a few efforts and amongst them construction-oriented research is even more rare. Methodical grounds for assessing schedule quality have been studied via literature study for the development of appropriate solutions to assess the quality of construction schedules. These findings combined with the experiences from practical implementations have resulted in the definition of a metric to measure schedule quality for construction projects. It includes 75 schedule requirements classified into 5 groups: general requirements, construction process, schedule mechanics, cost and resources and control process. This structure forms a core for the developed method to assess construction schedule quality termed as Schedule Health Assessment. The developed method has also the purpose of assisting project planners to produce and maintain good quality schedules starting from the project initiation until its completion, as via using the method to detect deficiencies of project schedules and other critical issues having importance with respect to schedule maintenance.","[Bragadin, Marco Alvise] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture, Viale Risorgimento 2, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; [Kahkonen, Kalle] Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Tekniikankatu 12, Tampere, Finland","Bragadin, MA (corresponding author), Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture, Viale Risorgimento 2, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",marcoalvise.bragadin@unibo.it,"Kahkonen, Kalle Esa Eelis/G-4335-2014","Kahkonen, Kalle Esa Eelis/0000-0002-8986-7721",Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna (CARISBO) - Bologna Italy [2013/0345],This work was supported by Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna (CARISBO) - Bologna Italy [progetto 2013/0345].,,38,4,4,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Since the resources required to perform these activities move from one stage to the other, a main objective of scheduling these projects is to maintain the continuity of work of these resources so as to minimize the idle time of resources. This requirement, often referred to as work continuity constraints, involves a tradeoff between total project duration and the resource idle time. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we provide an extensive literature summary of the topic under study. Although most research papers deal with the scheduling of construction projects, we show that this can be extended to many other environments. Second, we propose an exact search procedure for scheduling repetitive projects with work continuity constraints. This algorithm iteratively shifts repeating activities further in time in order to decrease the resource idle time. We have embedded this recursive search procedure in a horizon-varying algorithm in order to detect the complete tradeoff profile between resource idle time and project duration. The procedure has been coded in Visual C + + and has been validated on a randomly generated problem set. Finally, we illustrate the concepts on three examples. First, the use of our new algorithm is illustrated on a small fictive problem example from literature. In a second example, we show that work continuity constraints involve a tradeoff between total project duration and the resource idle time. A last example describes the scheduling of a well-known real-life project that aims at the construction of a tunnel at the Westerschelde in The Netherlands.","Univ Ghent, Dept Management Informat Operat Management & Tech, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; Vlerick Leuven Ghent Management Sch, Operat & Technol Management Ctr, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Vanhoucke, M (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Management Informat Operat Management & Tech, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Hoveniersberg 24, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",mario.vanhoucke@ugent.be,"Vanhoucke, Mario/D-8647-2015","Vanhoucke, Mario/0000-0001-6702-3563",,,,52,47,48,0,8,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Scheduling of renewal activities for a railway network is a critical task because these activities often require a significant amount of time and create a capacity conflict in operation scheduling. This paper discusses economic and technological aspects, opportunities, and constraints in the renewals of multiple rail infrastructure components at several locations in a railway network. We addressed and modeled a challenging situation in which there were interrelationships between different track lines, and thus, possession of a track line could affect the other track lines and prevent renewal works on them. A mathematical formulation for the railway infrastructure renewal scheduling problem in the network context was presented to minimize the total renewal and unavailability costs. A method based on a triple-prioritization rule and an optimal sharing of renewal times allocated for different types of rail infrastructure components in a possession is proposed to solve the problem. The method was applied to a real case of a regional railway network in Northern Netherlands and it was shown that up to 13% of total costs can be saved compared with the current scheduling practice.

However, previous models lacked the ability to quantify criticality in a manner similar to the critical path method. Previous spatial scheduling models did not provide seamless integration with site logistics planning of material staging and temporary facilities. This paper therefore extracts various float types that can exist in a spatial schedule. Three activity float metrics are defined using singularity functions: shift, rate, and combined floats. An algorithm is established to generate space float contours for a construction site. A validation example demonstrates the new float concepts and space float contours. This research makes two contributions to body of knowledge of construction scheduling. First, activity float metrics expand the capabilities of spatial scheduling models to assess the criticality of activities. Second, the concept of space float enables a direct integration between scheduling and other project management tasks like site layout, material logistics, and trades coordination.","[Said, Hisham M.

The framework introduces two new measures, buffer performance index and buffer variance, for measuring the expected remaining buffer and the actual remaining buffer on critical and noncritical chains based on the percentage completion for each activity at the end of the reporting period, respectively. To verify the proposed framework, the processes and measures have been applied to three projects, each with different complexities.

As such, the identification of pertinent turnaround strategies becomes increasingly important for senior management. Within the strategy-as-practice scholarly, there have been recent calls to move beyond empirical isolationism and to connect with other larger social phenomena; while across the turnaround literature there have been calls to explore the process and micro-structure of turnaround strategies in cyclical environments. To address this research gap, the purpose of the study is to adopt a tall ontology by blending the strategy-as-practice lens with the organizational decline and turnaround lens. By drawing on five exploratory case studies of large Irish construction contractors, the central objective is thus to explore firms' turnaround strategizing practices during an environmental jolt. In order to advance our tall ontology, we developed a turnaround strategizing process model (and propositions) that integrates our findings, and which offers the fundamental building blocks of a new blended theory. We find that successful turnaround attempts entail the simultaneous interaction of non-aggressive cost retrenchment actions and non-extensive internationalization. The case studies further suggest that during a prolonged environmental jolt, cost retrenchment is more often a long-term strategy. Lastly, the findings provide valuable support for practitioners in developing a successful turnaround response, and in aiding the selection and timing of operational and strategic actions.","[Tansey, Paul] Inst Technol Sligo, Dept Civil Engn & Construct, Sligo, Ireland; [Tansey, Paul; Spillane, John P.; Brooks, Tara] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Nat & Built Environm, David Keir Bldg, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland","Tansey, P (corresponding author), Inst Technol Sligo, Dept Civil Engn & Construct, Sligo, Ireland.; Tansey, P (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Nat & Built Environm, David Keir Bldg, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",ptansey@itsligo.ie,"Spillane, John/AAK-9421-2021","Spillane, John/0000-0002-2106-2644",,,,107,2,2,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is used to overcome some pitfalls of PERT; however, MCS is time-consuming and requires large amount of data. Accordingly, fuzzy-set theory is used to quantify uncertainty associated with activities' durations. Several fuzzy-based techniques have been proposed; however, some difficulties are encountered in determining late times of activities and degree of criticality. The aim of this article is to present an analytical method for measuring criticality in a project network with fuzzy activity durations. A proposed method for measuring criticality degree (CD) of both project paths and activities is presented, avoiding pitfalls of previous fuzzy methods. Linear fuzzy activities' duration - that is commonly used in construction - is assumed. An example application is worked-out to illustrate the steps of the proposed method.

Systemic thinking, however, had no relationship with either stakeholder relationships or project success. Additional research is needed to examine the contribution of a wider range of personal attributes to stakeholder relationships and project success, and to assess whether this model is applicable in other industries and types of projects.

The financing cost can be minimized if the financing decision considers different financing alternatives such as short-term and long-term loans and lines of credit. Financing optimization should be integrated into time-cost tradeoff analysis to minimize total cost and maximize profit. This study proposes an integrated model that performs time-cost tradeoff analysis and financing optimization. A hybrid GALP algorithm is introduced to solve the optimization by combining genetic algorithms (GA) and linear programming (LP). The proposed model is tested using small and large networks: (1) to prove that optimal results are obtained in terms of the financing cost and profit if the proposed integrated model is used, (2) to validate the performance and structure of each model, and (3) to confirm the practicality of the proposed models in large networks.","[Alavipour, S.

Further, we build a new quality model, called quality performance index (QPI), to describe system reliability. The avoidance of assigning the node weights and referring to expert experience adds to the practicality of the quality calculation. In the process of decision-making, we use contractual time, cost, and quality as benchmarks for evaluation of feasible solutions. Then, we combine an immune genetic algorithm with a constriction factor particle swarm optimization to get a new algorithm, called immune genetic particle swarm optimization (IGPSO). We test the effectiveness of IGPSO using two typical test functions and solve a practical example. Optimization results proved the practicability and validity of the model.

Various contractors thus execute different projects and often apply differing scheduling practices. Since all projects involved in highway construction must be completed for the highway to be useful, the management of the various projects should preferably be integrated. To assist project controllers in schedule integration, this study proposes algorithms based on standardized codes and network modules. A computer system was also designed to help contractors use these modules for scheduling, and ultimately to let project controllers combine these schedules electronically. A questionnaire survey and industry feedback revealed the potential benefits of using the proposed algorithms for generating and integrating schedules, respectively.

Current scheduling software fix the resource supply-demand problem by performing a Resource-Constrained Scheduling (RCS) technique, but they report incorrect total float values and a broken critical path. RCS calculations suggest that activities have float but much of this float does not exist (phantom float). Phantom float is created in resource-constrained schedules because the existing RCS methodologies neglect the resource relationships that arise between activities when competing for the same but unavailable resources. This paper illustrates the presence of phantom float in Primavera's P6 and Microsoft's Project schedules. After removing phantom float from the schedule, non-critical activities may become resource critical and the actual float may be shorter than calculated or may be altogether non-existent. Users of P6 and MS Project should recognize that the calculation of total float by the software relies on a time based context (LF - EF and/or LS - ES) ignoring the presence of resource constraints. Therefore, the float reported cannot be trusted or used to mitigate delaying events, like the traditional time-based context definition of total float suggests. Currently, research is being carried out in order to remove phantom float from P6 and Microsoft Project schedules.","[Franco-Duran, Diana M.; de la Garza, Jesus M.] Virginia Tech, 200 Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA","Franco-Duran, DM (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, 200 Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA.",dianitaf@vt.edu,,,,,,23,1,1,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

The methodology includes a literature review, followed by an algorithm that relies upon singularity functions. Its first two steps refer to the existing Productivity Scheduling Method, which is extended with mathematical steps to handle maximum constraints correctly.

However, the concepts of total float and critical path lose their significance after applying resource-constrained scheduling (RCS) techniques. RCS techniques mitigate the resource supply-demand problem but break the critical path. As a result, several algorithms have been developed to identify a continuous critical path in resource-constrained schedules. This study reviews and evaluates the performance of eight RCS-related algorithms with the purpose of identifying the shortcomings that must be addressed so they can be applied for delay analysis. The review shows that a systematic procedure is needed to (1) incorporate and handle dynamic resource links when the schedule is updated, and (2) select a potential resource links configuration. Addressing these limitations will make the algorithms more practical for real construction and engineering projects and will allow a more realistic delay analysis since schedules will reflect the real conditions of the project (resource loaded). This study (1) discusses potential solutions to the shortcomings of the existing algorithms, (2) provides recommendations on the methods that can be used by industry professionals, and (3) proposes a system to facilitate the selection of an algorithm based on the common features (heuristic), constraints (removal of logic links), and project characteristics (resources and calendars).","[Franco-Duran, Diana M.; de la Garza, Jesus M.] Virginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 750 Drillfield Dr,200 Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Franco-Duran, DM (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 750 Drillfield Dr,200 Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",dianitaf@vt.edu; chema@vt.edu,,,,,,29,3,3,2,36,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

In construction schedules, the relationships among constraints directly impact the scheduling solution. Conflicting constraints make solving a scheduling problem infeasible, while redundant constraints, especially disjunctive ones, could tremendously increase computation time. Conflicting and redundant constraints hence should be determined in the prescheduling stage to enhance scheduling feasibility and efficiency. In this regard, a constraint integration reasoning framework is developed to identify primary and secondary conflicts and redundancies in schedule constraints. The framework comprises sets of rules for the inference of these conditions within each activity or between two activities. It also computes the feasible range of activity durations, which will be useful for planners in modifying and updating schedules. The framework has been applied to alternative construction scheduling and implemented in (ECLPSe)-P-i, a constraint logic programming language. An illustrative example of a simplified gas pipe installation project is presented to demonstrate the usage of the framework as a prescheduling constraint analysis tool.

Qualitative content analysis for the collected data by grouping the responses into themes and frequency and percentage derived for the various themes. The main findings of the study revealed that the challenges affecting emerging contractors are the lack of financial support from the commencement of projects and during project execution; the extraordinary level of competition among the pool of emerging contractors and delay in payment from government institutions and client which have impacted their business operations. The study was done on emerging construction companies that are in the Gauteng Province of South Africa only, but the results may be applicable in other provinces, even beyond South Africa. The empirical results confirmed that the challenges and risk factors which have been identified as lack of financial support from financial institutions in the initial stage of projects and during project execution; high level of competition among emerging contractors and delay in payment from government institutions and client faced by emerging contractors have an impact on their operations and sustainable growth in the construction industry.","[Bikitsha, Linda; Amoah, Christopher] Univ Free State, Dept Quant Surveying & Construct Management, Bloemfontein, South Africa","Amoah, C (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Dept Quant Surveying & Construct Management, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",amoahc@ufs.ac.za,"Amoah, Christopher/AAJ-3578-2021","Amoah, Christopher/0000-0001-7657-3874",,,,49,1,1,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

Y.",,,Relationship between organizational sizes and contractors' risk pricing behaviors for weather risk under different project values and durations,JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CONSTRUCTION; CULTURE,"A problem that always annoys building employers and their consultants when drafting building contracts is whether it is more cost efficient to retain certain risks with themselves or to transfer the same to contractors, and it has long been a difficulty to accurately estimate the cost for transferring risks to the other contract party. It is a very common market practice to remove contractors' entitlement to extension of time due to inclement weather, and in view of the significant impacts that inclement weather posed on construction progress, it would be helpful to assess the associated costs for such risk allocation exercises in order to ensure that it is a cost-effective transaction. The costs for these potential weather-caused delays are priced by contractors in their returned tenders. This risk-pricing behavior is affected by the contractor's risk perception and risk attitude. However, merely working out contractors' risk perception and risk attitude patterns is inadequate, as they may vary in accordance with different organizational sizes and project backgrounds. Therefore, further studies should be carried out on the implications of project information, such as project value and contract period, on different-sized contractors' risk behaviors. In this research, a questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the weather-risk-pricing behavioral patterns of various-sized contractors under different given project scenarios. The survey revealed that the impacts of project value and contract period (and, thus, the intensity of work and scale of exposure to weather risk) were significant on contractors' risk behaviors, and these impacts varied in accordance with different organizational sizes. The medium-sized contractors' pricing behaviors were rather constant under different project values and contract periods, while both small and large contractors behaved differently when the intensity of work and scale of risk exposure varied. Despite the fact that contractors of various sizes behaved differently in some given scenarios, the number of days of delaying cost allowed by them in returned tenders were generally less than the actual number of days of inclement weather affecting work.","[Chan, Edwin H.

However, the Indian construction industry suffers from many material management issues that lead to ineffectiveness in the material management system. Previous studies in the field have not comprehensively examined the issues affecting the schedule and cost performance of construction projects. To address this gap, this study identified a total of 33 material management issues from the existing literature and conducted interviews with 15 material management experts with more than 10 years of experience in material management. The data were collected through the use of a questionnaire survey completed by 86 procurement professionals. The results revealed six factors with a significant positive influence on the disruption of projects' schedule and cost performances. Improper delivery of materials is the most critical material management factor, followed by inadequate planning of materials, lack of information and communication, financial issues in procurement, changes in scope of materials, and difficulty in transportation. The findings of this study enable construction practitioners to effectively focus on the few critical factors to improve the material management system and thereby enhancing projects' schedule and cost performances.

In order to analyze the synergistic impacts of SMS and SR on SP, path analysis, correlation analysis and mediation analysis were conducted using hypotheses concerning with the main subdimensions. Findings The results indicated SMS and SR decreased the project risk level and improved SP of real estate projects. Furthermore, the effect of SR partially mediated the relationship between the SMS and SP. Practical implications Findings in this research contribute to improve SP in real estate industry as well as other industries by the active assumption of SR and the successful implementation of SMS.

However, the operations used in performing the BV method often differ due to the various government procurement requirements. Consequently, some of the methods popular in the academic community are not easily incorporated in the BV method in some countries. To enhance the procurement process, this study aims to gain experience by applying the well-known analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to weight the decision criteria for selecting BV contractors of two construction projects in Taiwan. Through these two case studies, this work confirms that the AHP provides a significant benefit for considering the individual preferences of all decision-makers when weighting the criteria. However, this study finds two major potential obstacles, the legal requirements associated with using the AHP and the time it takes to implement the AHP. To overcome these obstacles, this work suggests guidelines to meet the legal requirements for implementing the AHP in the BV contractor selection, and proposes several strategies to shorten the AHP implementation time. The lessons learned here are relevant to those countries in which BV method must be performed in a transparent and strictly regulated environment.","[Wang, Wei-Chih; Lin, Chun-Chang; Lee, Ming-Tsung; Cheng, Yuan-Yuan] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; [Yu, Wen-der] Chung Hua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Hsinchu 30012, Taiwan; [Yang, I-Tung] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Wang, WC (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1001 Univ Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",weichih@mail.nctu.edu.tw; wenderyu@chu.edu.tw; ityang@mail.ntust.edu.tw; cclin.janet@msa.hinet.net; greglee@nsrrc.org.tw; dereck@nsrrc.org.tw,,,"National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC95-2211-E-009-244]; Ministry of Education of Taiwan via the Aim for the Top University (MOU-ATU) program",The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their careful evaluation and thoughtful comments.

Effective management of such systems requires agencies to prioritize capacity projects with consideration of potential stakeholder-divergence resulting from competing stakeholder values and budgetary constraints. Strategic prioritization of investment should consider the values of several stakeholder perspectives, such as managing agencies, the public, closely associated commerce, environmental agencies, and others. This paper will demonstrate an integrated scenario analysis, multicriteria analysis, and integer-programming approach to identify investment portfolios that meet budgetary constraints while promoting investments most suitable for coordination among diverse stakeholders. The approach will be demonstrated on six high-priority federal transportation infrastructure projects in the United States. The results illustrate the need and use of stakeholder-divergence as a factor in federal investment policies.

Although companies in the industry have played a significant role in developing the green building market, scarce studies have analyzed changes in the market from the perspectives of these corporations. Also, few studies classify green building companies by characteristics. To fill these gaps of knowledge, we explored the characteristics of the US green building market from a corporate perspective, specifically investigating green contractors and design firms. We first collected data of 464 top US green building companies identified by the Engineering News-Record over the past decade and explored the development trend of the green building market, based on the green revenue generated by these companies. We found that the general growth trend in the US green building market in the past decade could be divided into three stages: a rapid-growth stage (2000-2008), a steady-growth stage (2009-2013), and a maturity and transformation stage (2014-2016). We then categorized the 464 organizations into three groups with distinct characteristics by k-means cluster analysis techniques, including mature green building companies, sector-oriented green building companies, and primary-stage green building companies. This study provides the academic and practitioner communities with a holistic understanding of the development of the US green building market from the view of burgeoning companies. Corporate-level management systems and sustainable practices of the three clusters of green building companies also provide guidance for construction companies in the various stages of transformation towards sustainability to adopt different strategies.

Coordination can be formal or informal. Research shows that informal coordination of residual and unforeseen interdependencies enhances time saving and facilitates better understandings. Still though, many sub-contractors choose not to coordinate informally. The purpose of this paper is to identify drivers that enhance or inhibit informal coordination among sub-contractors during project execution. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative, explorative case study approach was applied, involving 15 SME sub-contractors within the offshore wind power energy sector. Findings - Six drivers which enhance informal coordination and three drivers which inhibit informal coordination among sub-contractors in projects were identified. Practical implications - The findings imply that management in project-oriented organizations can enhance informal coordination across project sub-contractors in the project execution phase by facilitating trust building; by emphasizing previous collaboration successes with the sub-contractors and the possibility of future common projects; by being explicit about expectations on informal coordination; and by developing sub-contractor contracts that are not very tight in economic terms, but instead give some leeway in relation to coordination. Originality/value - The paper contributes to a gap on coordination within projects and in the specificity of the context of offshore wind energy in which the concept of informal coordination across sub-contractors is explored.","[Aagaard, Annabeth] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Leadership & Corp Strategy, Strategy & Management, Slagelse, Denmark; [Eskerod, Pernille] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Leadership & Corp Strategy, Slagelse, Denmark; [Madsen, Erik Skov] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Technol & Innovat, Odense, Denmark","Aagaard, A (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Leadership & Corp Strategy, Strategy & Management, Slagelse, Denmark.",aaa@sdu.dk,"Eskerod, Pernille/J-5380-2014; Madsen, Erik Skov/T-4784-2018","Eskerod, Pernille/0000-0002-3291-2763; Madsen, Erik Skov/0000-0001-7552-7673; Aagaard, Annabeth/0000-0002-6213-0682",,,,60,10,10,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

States issue permits to trucks beyond legal weight limits and collect fees to compensate for additional damage. To study the extent to which state departments of transportation (DOTs) have allowed passage of overweight loads, the first objective of this paper was to characterize overweight load permit practices among all U.S. states, and the second objective was to identify stakeholders' perspectives on how to modernize current overweight permit practices. Through an analysis of existing fee policies, this research has characterized the state of the practice in permit fees for overweight loads on public roadways, and evaluated these practices. The subsequent data showed a wide array of policies on overweight permitting, such that a single interstate overweight freight trip might encounter several diverse overweight permitting policies. Although the range of weights permitted with overweight permits can lead to substantial infrastructure damage, the median user-fee for a flat-rate annual overweight permit was only $250 without any limit on maximum allowable number of trips. In this paper, the authors discuss permitting structures, the prevalence of each type of structure in the United States, and the values assigned to permits. In practice, policymakers, rather than engineering and economic studies, have usually set fees. Several interviews were conducted in South Carolina as a case study to assess stakeholders' perspectives on overweight truck fee policies in the state. South Carolina charged $30 for a single-trip permit and $100 for an annual permit at the time of the study. Overweight policies among all states showed no clear or consistent relationship between the cost of an annual permit and the fee imposed for a single trip. For example, the South Carolina annual permit fee equated to 3.33 times the single-trip permit fee, whereas an Ohio study found that annual permit holders made an average of 24.8 trips with annual permits. Policy makers should evaluate the number of trips and miles that annual-permit holders incur before establishing annual permit fees. A recent study in South Carolina found that damage costs for loads exceeding highway standards were higher than overweight fees covered. Interviews with stakeholders showed that, fundamentally, South Carolina's trucking stakeholders did not hold common ideas on the objective of overweight permits and fee structures. South Carolina will not likely find fee revisions and increases politically viable until a consensus develops around the objective of overweight permitting and fees. The South Carolina DOT and trucking industry representatives should work together in an ongoing focus group to develop common understanding of issues, consensus around objectives, and provisions for fairness that will address industry concerns. This paper's findings on South Carolina stakeholders' perspectives will provide input to other regions in the country that are considering revising overweight trucking fees.","[Dunning, Anne] Univ Kansas, Dept Urban Planning, 1465 Jayhawk Blvd,311 Marvin Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Dey, Kakan Chandra] Clemson Univ, Glenn Dept Civil Engn, 18G Lowry Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Chowdhury, Mashrur] Clemson Univ, Glenn Dept Civil Engn, Transportat Engn, 216 Lowry Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA","Dey, KC (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Glenn Dept Civil Engn, 18G Lowry Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",kdey@clemson.edu,,"Dunning, Anne/0000-0001-9018-4904",South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT),"The authors acknowledge the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT), which provided funding for this research.

This study examines how relational governance influences contractors' adaptability to foreign situations and whether such associations are positively moderated by international environmental complexity. Design/methodology/approach A crosssectional survey methodology was applied to collect primary data through questionnaires sent to domestic contractors in China and South Korea (hereafter Korea). Multiple regression analysis was used to test the effects of four dimensions of relational governance on contractor adaptability. Thereafter, the Chinese and Korean subsamples were tested separately through moderated regression analysis to explore differences in the influence of relational governance on adaptability. Findings The results showed that quality communication, favor exchange and establishing an emotional relationship significantly and positively affected a contractor's adaptability. However, there were significant differences between the Chinese and Korean international contractors in terms of the moderating effects of international environment complexity. Research limitations/implications East Asian engagement in international development is not limited to China and Korea alone, and the study should be replicated using large representative samples from more countries, such as Japan, to gain a fuller understanding of the influence of relational governance. Originality/value The results have great significance for the managers of international contractors in East Asian countries and contribute to the research on relational governance and contractor adaptability.","[Lin, Yi-Hsin; Guo, Yanzhe] Southeast Univ, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Kim, Chan-Joong] NOW Architects, Seoul, South Korea; [Chen, Po-Han] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Qian, Mingwei] Suzhou New Dist Technol Ind Dev Co Ltd, Suzhou, Peoples R China","Chen, PH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.",pohanchen@ntu.edu.tw,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71573037],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71573037.,,96,1,1,9,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

The matrix structure considers periodic staffing of project teams which has been found to be efficient for non-scarce human resources but is impractical for individual experts. Our objective is to develop and evaluate an alternative approach for resource planning and scheduling that might be useful for project portfolio management. The method we suggest is an extension of a recently developed optimization model for a job-shop with several machines and chance-constrained deliveries. Our method determines in advance the hiring and releasing points of individual experts that maximize economic gain subject to chance-constrained delivery commitments. For this purpose, we use a simulation based on a greedy priority dispatching rule as well as a cyclic coordinate descent search-algorithm. A benchmarking of the staffing of project teams and the integrative methods shows that integrated planning and scheduling is a very useful tool for the decision-making process in project portfolio management.

In this paper, we focus on improving the accuracy of project duration forecasting by introducing a forecasting approach for Earned Value Management (EVM) and Earned Duration Management (EDM) that combines the schedule performance and schedule adherence of the project in progress. As the schedule adherence has not yet been defined formally for EDM, we extend the EVM-based measure of schedule adherence, the p-factor, to EDM and refer to this measure as the c-factor. Moreover, we aim to improve the ability to indicate the expected forecasting accuracy for a project by extending the EVM concept of project regularity to EDM. The introduced forecasting approach and the EDM project regularity indicator are applied to a large number of real-life projects, mainly situated in the construction sector. The conducted empirical experiment shows that the project duration forecasting accuracy can be increased by focusing on both the schedule performance and schedule adherence. Further, this study shows that the EDM project regularity indicator is indeed a more reliable indicator of forecasting accuracy.","[de Andrade, Paulo Andre] Techisa Brasil, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Martens, Annelies; Vanhoucke, Mario] Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vanhoucke, Mario] Vlerick Business Sch, Technol & Operat Management, Reep 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vanhoucke, Mario] UCL, UCL Sch Management, 1 Canada Sq, London E14 5AA, England","Vanhoucke, M (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.; Vanhoucke, M (corresponding author), Vlerick Business Sch, Technol & Operat Management, Reep 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.; Vanhoucke, M (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Sch Management, 1 Canada Sq, London E14 5AA, England.",pandre@techisa.net; annelies.martens@ugent.be; mario.vanhoucke@ugent.be,"Vanhoucke, Mario/D-8647-2015","Vanhoucke, Mario/0000-0001-6702-3563",,,,22,20,20,4,70,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Most literature on cost estimation focuses on specific estimation methods as generic techniques and little attention has been paid to the unique requirements at each project stage. This note attempts to identify the critical factors for effective estimation at various stages of typical construction projects. Drawing from organization control theory and cost estimating literature, this note develops a theoretical framework that identifies the critical factors for effective cost estimation during each project phase of a conventional construction project. The underlying logic is that as a cost estimating effort progresses, both task programmability and output measurability improve. As a result, control effort will shift from input-oriented control to a combination of output and behavior control.","Univ Sydney, Dept Civil Engn J05, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; NSW State Govt, Dept Commerce, Millers Point, NSW 2000, Australia","Liu, L (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Dept Civil Engn J05, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",l.liu@staff.usyd.edu.au; kai.zhu@commerce.nsw.gov.au,,,,,,21,43,44,4,39,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Such decision-making may have significant impact on the performance of the contractors. Using Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) and Classification and Regression (CRT) decision tree algorithms, this paper aims to develop bid/no-bid models for design-bid-build projects for contractors. Design/methodology/approach The models in this study have been developed using CHAID and CRT algorithms. Thirty-four bid/no-bid key factors were collected via extensive research. The bid/no-bid factors were listed based on their importance index as a result of a questionnaire distributed among the construction professionals. These factors were divided into five main risk categories - owner, project, bidding situation, contract and contractor - which were taken as inputs for the models. Split-sample validation was applied for testing and measuring the accuracy of the CHAID and CRT models. Moreover, Spearman's rank correlation and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests were employed to identify the statistical features of the received 169 responses. Findings The key bid/no-bid factors in construction industry were categorized in five related groups and ranked based on the relative importance index. It was found that the top 6 ranked bid/no-bid factors were (1) current workload, (2) need for work, (3) previous experience with employer; (4) timely payment by the employer; (5) availability of other projects for bidding (6) reputation of employer in the industry. Matrix comparison between all bid/no-bid groups was performed using Spearman's correlation to measure the relationship between each of the two paired groups. It was concluded that all the relationships were positive. Originality/value Existing bidding models require many inputs and advanced understanding of mathematics and software to run the model. Contractors tend to use easy, fast and available support methods. Excluding a great number of the bid/no-bid factors may affect the final decision. This paper proposes a bid/no-bid decision tree models for contractors of different sizes. It is the first study in the literature, to the best of authors' knowledge, to study bid/no-bid decision with the proposed decision tree algorithm. The proposed models in this study overcome the shortfalls of most previous models such as avoiding the complexity and difficulties of applying the concept. The proposed model will provide the contractors with a bid/no-bid decision based on the input for the defined bid factor groups. The proposed models display the soft spots and hot spots between the independent and dependent variables, which leads to a better decision. The proposed models display the result effectively in visual terms, easy to understand and easy to apply. The proposed models are a form of multiple effect (or variable) analysis which allows the companies to explain, describe, predict or classify an outcome.","[Gunduz, Murat; Al-Ajji, Ibrahim] Qatar Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Doha, Qatar","Gunduz, M (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Doha, Qatar.",mgunduz@qu.edu.qa,,,,,,49,0,0,4,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Unfortunately, the outcome of such trainings in terms of the percentage of increase in trainees' performance is not generally measured. On one hand, this lack of measurement results in contractors not recognizing the importance of training in enhancing workers' performance, and on the other hand, the training providers do not receive constructive feedback on the efficacy of their sessions. This study therefore attempts to bridge this gap by developing a regression model of the socioemotional, cognitive, and technical skills of workers and their performance. Data was collected on 137 workers from four training centers in India. Using the developed model, a learning curve was drawn between performance and training time. Additionally, skills versus training time curves were also plotted. The results indicate that workers' performance after training was far below the desired level of employers; the reason for this emerges from skills versus training time curves, where it is found that the training does not focus on enhancing socioemotional and cognitive skills. Therefore, the study recommends that training providers incorporate these skills in their training curriculum to achieve more desirable outputs from training.","[Johari, Sparsh; Jha, Kumar Neeraj] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, Delhi 110016, India","Johari, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, Delhi 110016, India.",sparshjo@gmail.com; knjha@civil.iitd.ac.in,,"Johari, Sparsh/0000-0002-1396-0188",,,,38,0,0,3,3,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

These two related methods possess virtues, but lack a unified theory so that they could complement each other. Therefore, this paper explores a new approach. Its contribution to the body of knowledge is threefold: First, dissimilarities in activity representation, start point, and velocity measurement are reviewed and their causes are explained graphically and mathematically. Second, multiple crews are expressed with singularity functions in a three-part model crew assignment, crew utilization, and crew linear schedule. The model is automatically updated when parameters are modified for what-if analyses. Third, LSM and LOB are united so that crews can be optimized seamlessly.

Given that diverse stakeholders are involved in the village development process, a comprehensive stakeholder analysis, especially understanding stakeholders' concerns and expectations, is of critical importance to project success. This paper describes a stakeholder analysis based on a typical retirement village. The main methods utilized in this research were case study and an interdisciplinary workshop comprising intensive work sessions and cross-functional review. The participants of this 2014 Brisbane workshop included four village managers from an Australian retirement village developer and eight academics from diverse disciplines from a large university. Through this workshop, 24 village stakeholders and their specific concerns and expectations were identified. Results suggest that both concerns and expectations of these stakeholders are multidimensional and vary considerably, and the concerns and expectations of different stakeholders have complex relationships. Implications for a retirement village development are also proposed. The findings of the study serve as a valuable reference for developers' understanding of stakeholder concerns and expectations, and for taking corresponding actions in the final stages of the retirement village development.","[Hu, Xin; Xia, Bo; Skitmore, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Garden Point Campus,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Buys, Laurie; Kennedy, Rosemary; Drogemuller, Robin] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Design, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Hu, X (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Garden Point Campus,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",huxincqu@gmail.com,"Xia, Bo/J-1355-2012; Skitmore, Martin/I-9743-2012","Xia, Bo/0000-0001-7694-4743; Skitmore, Martin/0000-0001-7135-1201; Buys, Laurie/0000-0001-8917-0863; Drogemuller, Robin/0000-0001-5746-8980; Hu, Xin/0000-0003-3534-2855",,,,53,8,8,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

Trade-off optimization among them is significant for the improvement of the overall benefits of construction projects. In this paper, a novel optimization model, named as Chaotic Initialized Multiple Objective Differential Evolution with Adaptive Mutation Strategy (CA-MODE), is developed to deal with the time-cost-quality trade-off problems. The proposed algorithm utilizes the advantages of chaos sequences for generating an initial population and an external elitist archive to store non-dominated solutions found during the evolutionary process. In order to maintain the exploration and exploitation capabilities during various phases of optimization process, an adaptive mutation operation is introduced. A numerical case study of highway construction is used to illustrate the application of CA-MODE. It has been shown that non-dominated solutions generated by CA-MODE assist project managers in choosing appropriate plan which is other- wise hard and time-consuming to obtain. The comparisons with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), multiple objective differential evolution (MODE) and previous results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","[Cheng, Min-Yuan; Duc-Hoc Tran; Cao, Minh-Tu] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, 43,Sec 4,Keelung Rd, Keelung 106, Taiwan","Tran, DH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, 43,Sec 4,Keelung Rd, Keelung 106, Taiwan.",duchoc87@gmail.com,,"Cao, Minh-Tu/0000-0002-3793-008X",,,,31,6,6,2,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

With economic sustainability as a primary aim, the coordination and prioritization of investments has been a challenge in part because of Afghanistan's volatile security situation along with the intricacies of the negotiating and coordinating efforts of numerous stakeholders. An understanding of the contributions of infrastructure systems and associated projects to the national development strategy is needed. This paper formulates a scenario-informed multicriteria approach to prioritize major project investments for infrastructure development subject to deep, nonprobabilistic uncertainties. The methods are inclusive of stakeholder values and accounts for deep uncertainties in governance, security, economy, environment, workforce, and other topics. The methods are applied in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province to assist in the selection among twenty-seven candidate infrastructure projects that are vulnerable to potential refugee immigration among other emergent conditions. The paper describes the relationships of selected projects to strategic goals while facilitating collaboration among government and nongovernment investors, donors, technologists, and other stakeholders.

As such, this study set out to reveal factors affecting the successful management of the diverse interests of end-user stakeholders of the PPP road projects in Nigeria. Using factors from related literature, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to users of two major PPP road in operation in Nigeria: Lekki/Epe Toll and Apakun Murtala Mohammed PPP toll road. A total of 282 questionnaires were returned representing 70.5% response rate. Cronbach's alpha test was used to check reliability levels of the questionnaire variables (i.e., Likert scale questions) while factor analysis was used to establish the underlying factors affecting the successful participation of end-users stakeholders in PPP road in Nigeria. These underlying factors were fully discussed. It was concluded that active involvement of end-users stakeholders in decision-making from inception to conclusion will solve the problem of marginalization of end-user stakeholder's in Nigeria PPP road projects.","[Toriola-Coker, Luqman Olalekan] Yaba Coll Technol, Lagos, Nigeria; [Alaka, Hafiz] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Herts, England; [Agbali, Mohammed] Natl Informat Technol Dev Agcy, Abuja, Nigeria; [Bello, Wasiu Adeniran] Univ Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria; [Pathirage, Chaminda] Wolverhampton Univ, Wolverhampton, England; [Oyedele, Lukmon] Univ West England, Bristol, Avon, England","Alaka, H (corresponding author), Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Herts, England.",hafizalaka@outlook.com,"Pathirage, Chaminda/AAQ-7567-2021",,,,,96,3,3,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

To enable the productivity and sustainable economic growth across the African continent, the infrastructure development projects are needed. Recently Africa has become a destination of Chinese Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management (EPCM) companies. The majority of these large Chinese EPCM companies find it difficult to manage projects in the way that satisfy all stakeholders in Africa due to a number of issues - political, social, historical, personal contexts, and technical. Chinese management approach is regarded as informal by nature generally referred as guanxi management. Literature review and media reports reveal that Chinese model of managing stakeholders in projects is characterized by the informal management approach (guanxi). The informal Chinese management is vital to projects success in China therefore, it is important to explore the informal (guanxi) management approach in EPCM projects in Africa. This paper investigates how Chinese Project Managers manage stakeholders in EPCM in Africa by adopting a mix research method to investigate the Chinese stakeholder management approach in West Africa. The research uses a field observation and survey questionnaires. It is found in practice that the Chinese only use guanxi management approach when certain stakeholders such as project owners and sponsors, in addition, the whole stakeholders' group in EPCM projects are not all satisfied with the informal (guanxi) management approach of the Chinese PM.","[Tchumtcha Wembe, Paulin] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Construct Econ & Management, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa","Wembe, PT (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Construct Econ & Management, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa.",pwembe@gmail.com,,,,,,34,1,1,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

Design/methodology/approach The conceptual model was developed with twenty hypotheses based on the literature review. Then a questionnaire survey was conducted, and the collected data were analyzed by Partial Least squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) for validating the proposed model. Finally, the findings were discussed by a comparative study to explain the different effects of the formal and informal relationship on megaproject performance, and the managerial implications are presented for the stakeholders to implement the relationship management in the megaprojects. Findings The research finding reveals that formal relationship plays a dominating role in cost, quality, and labor protection; meanwhile, it is still more reliable in improving coordination, safety and environmental protection. Both formal and informal relationship is equally important towards collaboration and scheduling while the informal relationship is more effective in communication and project transparency. Originality/value The study extends the knowledge of relationship management in the domain of the megaproject performance. It provides a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the impact of formal and informal stakeholder relationships on ten aspects of the megaproject performance by the proposed conceptual model and PLS-SEM results. The research findings contribute to the theory of relationship management on how the different influences between formal and informal stakeholder relationships lead to better megaproject performance from inter-organizational level to project and societal level.","[Xue, Jin; Shen, Geoffrey Qiping; Zafar, Irfan; Ekanayake, E.

However, recent studies reveal that application of LPS principles on projects is fragmented. The aim of the current study, therefore, is to develop an approach to support construction stakeholders in implementation of the LPS. Thirty semistructured interviews and three in-depth case studies were conducted with construction stakeholders. The authors developed a nonprescriptive but all-inclusive approach for supporting construction stakeholders in implementation of the LPS on construction projects. This study contributes to knowledge in engineering management because it provides new insight into how to apply the LPS holistically in the management of engineering projects. The study further provides evidence regarding current practice and performance of the LPS in the management of civil engineering projects, as demonstrated in the case studies. Finally, identification of the three levels of support (organizational, project, and external enabler) provides a focal point for construction practitioners to focus on in implementation of the LPS in the management of civil engineering projects.","[Daniel, Emmanuel Itodo] Southampton Solent Univ, Dept Construct Management & Built Environm, East Pk Terrace, Southampton SO14 0YN, Hants, England; [Pasquire, Christine] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Architecture Design & Built Environm, Ctr Lean Projects, 50 Shakespeare St, Nottingham NG1 4FQ, England; [Dickens, Graham] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Architecture Design & Built Environm, 50 Shakespeare St, Nottingham NG1 4FQ, England","Daniel, EI (corresponding author), Southampton Solent Univ, Dept Construct Management & Built Environm, East Pk Terrace, Southampton SO14 0YN, Hants, England.",emmanuel.daniel@solent.ac.uk; Christine.pasquire@ntu.ac.uk; Graham.dickens02@ntu.ac.uk,,"Daniel, Emmanuel Itodo/0000-0002-5675-1845",,,,77,9,9,10,73,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Recently, Physiological Status Monitors (PSMs) were validated as an accurate technology to assess physiological conditions during typical sport science and medicine testing procedures (e.g., treadmill and cycle ergometer protocols). However, sport science and medicine testing procedures cannot simulate routine construction worker movements in a comprehensive manner. Thus, this paper investigated the validity of two PSMs by comparing their measurements with gold standard laboratory instruments' measurements at rest and during dynamic activities resembling construction workforce's routine activities. Two physiological parameters such as heart rate and breathing rate were considered. Ten apparently healthy subjects participated in the study.

It shows that, in theory, the two paradigms seem to be incommensurable but complementary due to differences in knowledge and praxis between the two professions. The author discusses these differences side-by-side based on a review of the design science literature together with an analysis of the basic structure and knowledge involved in existing thermal simulation tools. This discussion aims to unfold a set of insights into the type of approach needed to move this research area further. It highlights the modus operandi of the building designer rather than focusing on collaborative efforts and sets up the backgrounds for designers to learn relevant concepts of building physics in an environment in which they can experiment with these concepts as 'craftsmen'.

Stakeholders often provide the needed resources and have the ability to control the interaction and resource flows in the network. They also ultimately have strong impact on an organisation's survival, and therefore appropriate management and involvement of key stakeholders should be an important part of any project management plan. A series of literature reviews was conducted to identify and categorise significant phases involved in the planning. For data collection, a questionnaire survey was designed and distributed amongst nearly 200 companies who were involved in the residential building sector in Australia. Results of the analysis demonstrate the engagement levels of the four stakeholder groups involved in the planning process and establish a basis for further stakeholder involvement improvement.

On the Chinese construction projects, it is common for project owners to execute power to indicate their position and ensure contractors' behavior. Meanwhile, a contract plays a crucial role in reducing opportunism and fostering contractors' cooperative behavior. Based on the power and contract literature, this paper aims to explore the direct and interaction roles of owner power and contract mechanisms particularly owner expert and coercive power as well as contract control and coordination functions in improving contractors' cooperative behavior. We also adopted two dimensions of cooperative behavior, namely in-role and extra-role behavior. A questionnaire survey was employed and data were collected from employees in the Chinese construction industry. We analyzed the data and compared the results between project owners and contractors. Data analyses show that 1) project contractors and owners perceive different levels of owners' expert power, contractors' in-role and extra-role behavior; 2) from the contractors' view, owners' expert power and contract coordination have positive influences on contractors' in-role behavior; owners' coercive power, expert power, and contract coordination positively affect contractors' extra-role behavior, while contract control plays a negative role; 3) contract control and coordination do play moderating roles on the relationship between expert power and contractors' cooperative behavior. These findings are interpreted in light of the Chinese culture and suggestions are provided regarding how project owners could exercise power and contract to foster cooperation with their contractors.

Nonetheless, previous studies indicated that the issue of competencies to perform and sustain such practices over time is of a significant concern. This study aims to explore the key attributes of designers' competencies for PtD practices in construction. Design/methodology/approach By using the Scopus database, a total of 86 papers related to PtD in construction published in peer-reviewed journals were reviewed and analysed using the well-established systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. Findings The review indicates that in order to be competent in PtD implementation, designers need to be equipped with tacit and explicit knowledge, technical and soft skills and experience related to PtD. Furthermore, the review identifies attributes of these competencies. Additionally, a framework that links key PtD elements/principles with the PtD competencies is presented. Practical implications The findings would enable contribution to the industry by providing the necessary references for design organisations to improve their designers' PtD competencies and hence, be able to meet their responsibility under relevant occupational safety and health (OSH) legislative framework. Originality/value This study extends the PtD literature in the construction context by providing deeper insights into the conceptualisation of relationship between competent designers and PtD elements. The novelty also lies in the consolidation of PtD competency attributes for designers in construction that could act as a reference for any future developments related to PtD competency assessment for designers.","[Che Ibrahim, Che Khairil Izam; Belayutham, Sheila] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Civil Engn, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [Manu, Patrick] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Mahamadu, Abdul-Majeed] Univ West England, Fac Environm & Technol, Bristol, Avon, England","Ibrahim, CKIC (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Civil Engn, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",chekhairil449@uitm.edu.my; sheila6913@salam.uitm.edu.my; patrick.manu@manchester.ac.uk; Abdul.Mahamadu@uwe.ac.uk,"Belayutham, Sheila/AAZ-3012-2021; Manu, Patrick/N-9004-2013","Belayutham, Sheila/0000-0003-2009-2603; Mahamadu, Abdul-Majeed/0000-0001-7757-8562; Manu, Patrick/0000-0001-7766-8824; Che Ibrahim, Che Khairil Izam/0000-0002-7728-3702","National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), MalaysiaUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USANational Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) [03-16/03/DCM/2020/01]","The work described in this paper was fully supported by a research grant from the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Malaysia (Ref No. 03-16/03/DCM/2020/01).

In the last twenty years, improvements have been made largely due to safety interventions that exceed compliance with government regulations. Researchers have long attempted to identify the most effective safety programs. However, studies in the past focused only on a small subset of potential injury-prevention options. In addition, to date, there has yet to be a study that documents a comprehensive list of safety strategies implemented by industry-leading companies. This research addresses this knowledge gap by creating a comprehensive list of construction-safety strategies from relevant literature and supplementing it with input from an expert panel. Once the strategies were identified (n=104), the research team conducted interviews with representatives from 57 projects in the United States to determine which strategies were implemented on each project and the project's recordable injury rate (RIR). The data were then analyzed to determine the total proportion of potential strategies implemented and examine the relationship between each strategy and the RIR. The results reveal that 14 strategies differentiate safety performance (P>0.05) and that 22 strategies were implemented by 100% of the sample projects. The implications are that the 22 practices implemented in all projects can now be considered a foundation of a safety program, and the 14 differentiators are the keys to improved safety performance.","[Hinze, Jimmie] Univ Florida, Rinker Sch Bldg Construct, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Hallowell, Matthew; Baud, Kevin] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Hallowell, M (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, 428 UCB,1111 Engn Dr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",hinze@ufl.edu; matthew.hallowell@colorado.edu; baud.kevin@gmail.com,"Hallowell, Matthew R/G-7918-2016",,,,,14,109,109,0,51,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The development of age-friendly communities (AFCs) has been encouraged for improving health and well-being of older adults. Hence, this study aimed to deepen the understanding of AFCs in China and to investigate the integrated relationships between AFCs and the quality of life (QoL) of older adults, using a large-scale questionnaire survey. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted in Hefei, China, to investigate the complicated relationships between the components of AFCs and the QoL of older adults. Ultimately, 1,383 valid questionnaires were collected from senior respondents aged more than 60 years. Several statistical methods, including reliability analysis, correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM), were adopted to develop an integrated model for AFC components and the QoL of older adults. Findings Six AFC components and four older adults' QoL factors were identified. The SEM results revealed integrated relationships between specific AFC components and the QoL of older adults: (1) physical QoL was affected by outdoor spaces, public transportation, housing and community and health services; (2) psychological QoL was predicted by most of the AFC components except community and health services; and (3) environmental QoL and social QoL were both influenced by outdoor spaces, communication and information and community and health services. Practical implications In order to enhance the QoL of older adults, it is suggested that outdoor spaces need to be enlarged by fully using the facilities and playgrounds of middle schools and renovating the older buildings. The locations of public transportation stations are recommended to be revised to be within a 5-minute walking distance of senior residents. Improvements to the social environment of AFCs, by increasing the coverage of medical services and creating multiple approaches to recreational activities, are encouraged. Originality/value These findings have empirical significance for urban planners and policy-makers in regard to identifying major components of AFCs and understanding the effect of those components on the QoL of older adults.","[Yu, Jingyu; Wang, Jingfeng] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Ma, Guixia] Hefei Univ Technol, Maxism, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Ding, Wenxuan; Mao, Jiangfeng] Second Construct Engn Co LTD, China Construct Engn Bur 3, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jingfeng] Anhui Key Lab Civil Engn Struct & Mat, Hefei, Peoples R China","Ma, GX (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Maxism, Hefei, Peoples R China.",yujingyu@hfut.edu.cn; maguixia2020@163.com; 449093022@qq.com; 402129250@qq.com; jfwang008@163.com,,,,,,61,0,0,22,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Safety professionals' perceptions of the effectiveness of training practices in safety training sessions were sought in a survey administered to the top 400 contractors in the U.S. The study shows that contractors are sensitive to organizational, feedback, content, process, and worker issues. Whenever they encounter language problems, they use visual aids, and provide translators and safety guidelines written in workers' own language. Very few statistically significant differences are observed when the findings are analyzed from the point of view of the demographic characteristics of the respondents. The contribution of this study is that it conveys the views of safety personnel about how safety learning can be achieved, sustained and improved by addressing organizational, feedback, content, process, and worker issues in training sessions. It provides project managers with best practices in safety training sessions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

The parties' preferred POIs were identified as follows: all three parties emphasize the objectives of construction quality, service quality, cost, time, and lifecycle cost very much. Individually, the private sector prefer the objectives of profit making and government support, the government prefer the objectives of budget saving and risk transfer, and the general public prefer the objectives of toll rate and the facilities' quantities. Furthermore, a satisfaction adjustment model was proposed based on the interrelationships of the adjusting POIs and their impact on the stakeholders' satisfaction by using the feedback loops of System Dynamics (SD).

Stakeholder behavior and stakeholder management are key success factors for project portfolios. Furthermore, stakeholder management must not only focus on single stakeholders but also account for stakeholders influencing one another in fairly complex interactions of multiple and potentially interdependent stakeholders. Our quantitative study of internal key stakeholders' engagement in the PPM process is based on a survey using 223 project portfolios from medium to large firms in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. We investigate the intensity of stakeholders' engagement in the three phases of the PPM process compared with expectations from PPM standards and role descriptions. Further, we analyze the interdependencies between the levels of stakeholder engagement and identify patterns of stakeholder behavior. Our study assists in explaining the relevance of stakeholders to PPM. We further integrate stakeholder theory with a highly relevant management approach (PPM) and thus enhance the explanatory value of stakeholder theory. Finally, the current findings enable managers to address stakeholders more effectively through an increased understanding of stakeholder behavior and its consequences.","[Beringer, Claus] Siemens AG, Mobil & Logist Div, Strateg Projects, D-8000 Munich, Germany; [Jonas, Daniel] Campana & Schott, Berlin, Germany; [Gemuenden, Hans Georg] Berlin Univ Technol, Berlin, Germany","Beringer, C (corresponding author), Siemens AG, Mobil & Logist Div, Strateg Projects, Otto Hahn Ring 6, D-8000 Munich, Germany.",claus.beringer@siemens.com; Daniel.jonas@campana-schott.com; hans.gemuenden@tim.tu-berlin.de,,,,,,86,32,32,7,88,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",8756-9728,1938-9507,,PROJ MANAG J,Proj.

Setup times are sequence dependent and serparately considered from processing times. Part sharing is fully allowed such that they can he used for the assembly of any passible product, rather than being preassociated to a specfic product. We employ constraint programming and mixed-integer linear programming to formulate the problem. Besides, several dispatching rules with machine feedback machanism are developped. Experimental studies are conducted based on test case problems with different scales and complexities. It is found that constraint programming is the most efficacious approach, whose solution fitness outperforms mixed-integer linear programming as well as all dispatching rules in both static and dynamic cases. On the other hand, dispatching rules are simple to implement, among which the earliest completion time rule is the most favourable. A real-time scheduling/rescheduling system has been constructed for the implementation of the proposed approaches to solve practical problems in production.","[Zhang, Sicheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Inst Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhang, SC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",sczhang@amss.ac.cn; sywang@amss.ac.cn,,"Wang, Shouyang/0000-0001-5773-998X; Zhang, Sicheng/0000-0001-7098-1834",,,,32,22,23,10,95,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

While the deterministic scheduling problems with known processing time and learning rate have been extensively studied, limited work exists to address the problems with both learning effect and uncertainty. In this paper, the single-machine scheduling problem with random nominal processing time and/or random job-based learning rate is studied, with the objective of minimizing the expected total flow time and expected makespan. Several optimal policies are obtained: first, the shortest expected processing time is optimal when only the nominal processing time is random; second, when the job-based learning rate is random, the optimal policy can be obtained by solving an assignment problem with random assignment cost. Computational study is conducted to offer insights on the behavior of optimal policy. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) is calculated as the difference between the expected objective value found by the optimal policy, and the expected objective value with perfect information. EVPI offers a practical way for decision makers to quantify the incentive and benefit of reducing uncertainty for the addressed problem. The results show that the performance of optimal policy will be negatively impacted by high variation of random parameters.","[Li, Haitao] Univ Missouri, Coll Business Adm, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Li, Haitao] Tianjin Univ Commerce, Sch Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China","Li, HT (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Coll Business Adm, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",lihait@umsl.edu,,,Thousand Talent Scholarship of China; Tianjin University of Commerce,The author thanks two anonymous referees and the Department Editor Bin Jiang for their helpful and constructive comments.

In the literature, various techniques have been developed to reduce consequent project delay of constrained resources. Most of these techniques assume single-skilled resources and use heuristic rules to decide which activity will receive the resource first and which ones to delay. To improve existing solutions, this paper introduces some modifications to heuristic resource-scheduling solutions, considering multiskilled resources. The proposed approach stores and utilizes information about the resource(s) that can be substituted when there is a shortage in another one. Using this information, less utilized resources can be combined to substitute the shortages in constrained resources during the shortage period, taking into consideration the loss in work productivity. To automate the proposed algorithm, a macroprogram has been written on a commercial scheduling software. An example application is presented to show the improved results of the proposed approach over existing heuristics. The use of the proposed approach as a better resource management tool within the construction industry is then discussed.","Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; Univ Mansoura, Dept Struct Engn, Mansoura, Egypt; El Saif Construct Co, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Hegazy, T (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",tarek@uwaterloo.ca; ahmalsha@hotmail.com; emeelb@mum.mans.eun.eg; ticheema.ipe@Zajel.net,"Elbeltagi, Emad/O-4312-2018","Elbeltagi, Emad/0000-0002-6568-3522",,,,11,39,41,0,8,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

When workspace interference is generated, securing work performance safety is difficult and constructability can deteriorate due to increased collision risk between resources. The objective of this study is to realize an active simulation system based on building information modeling (BIM) after constructing a genetic algorithm (GA) process for an alternative schedule that minimizes the simultaneous interference level of the schedule-workspace. To accomplish this task, the impact factor of workspace interference, which simultaneously considers schedule overlap and adjacency, was analyzed. From the impact factor, an optimized algorithm based on a location-constraint GA that can minimize workspace interference is suggested. The GA visually simulates the optimization level of the execution schedule compared to the initial plan through interlock with four-dimensional (4D) computer-aided design (CAD). A 4D CAD system that can analyze workspace interference by a GA was developed, and for the developed algorithm and system, a case verification was attempted for a railroad construction project. The results show how a simple visualization-oriented BIM system can be extended to an active schedule management system equipped with decision-making functions of workspace analysis.

The prototype system incorporates space-based scheduling techniques to recognize the space requirements of activities as a scheduling constraint. The space-based techniques are integrated with resource-based techniques for the production of schedules. The system also incorporates procedures to define and verify construction logic constraints associated with linear scheduling of vertical construction.

This paper presents the necessary requirements that scheduling systems should address to meet the needs and complexities of repetitive projects in practice. The repetitive scheduling method (RSM) provides a unified scheduling framework that applies to all types of repetitive projects. In RSM, projects are classified as discrete (vertical) or continuous (horizontal or linear) and then as uniform and nonuniform, depending on whether progress is measured using a counting scale or a dominant-attribute scale. RSM modeling elements include three types of activities (line, block, and bar) and 10 types of relationships (links) between activities. RP2, a computer program developed by the authors to validate the proposed scheduling approach, is used to develop the production diagrams and tabular reports of the target schedule for a complex of four-story apartment buildings for a low-income housing project. Sufficient detail is provided so that the project and its target schedule can be used to validate future research and to verify other systems.

Because of the size of most repetitive projects, efficient resource management plays a vital role in their successful implementation. However, resource levelling and allocation have not been formally investigated in repetitive projects. Heuristic methods and optimization techniques have been traditionally used to solve resource scheduling problems like the latter. Although heuristic methods can handle large-size projects, they do not guarantee optimal solutions. In this paper, resource levelling and allocation problems under LOB scheme are modelled as an optimization problem that guarantees optimal solutions. Resource continuity and logical dependency between activities are maintained where constant activity progress rate is assumed. An example project is used to demonstrate the details of model formulation. A complete solution for the range of feasible project durations is obtained as a Time-Resource Trade-Off curve. A pipeline project is used to validate the developed model revealing that the developed model is superior. The proposed model provides contractors with a complete picture for resource usage along with the range of feasible project durations from which the optimal alternative can be selected.","[Ammar, Mohammad A.] Tanta Univ, Fac Engn, Struct Engn Dept, Tanta 31521, Egypt","Ammar, MA (corresponding author), Tanta Univ, Fac Engn, Struct Engn Dept, Tanta 31521, Egypt.",mamammar@yahoo.com,,,,,,31,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

The chromosomes of the schedules that violate this condition are referred to as finance-infeasible chromosomes. Infeasibility related to finance is peculiar to finance-based scheduling problems. In scheduling problems, chromosomes that are infeasible based on precedence relationships are typically penalized. This paper introduces a repair algorithm for the finance-infeasible chromosomes generated within the GA systems. The repair algorithm identifies the periods exhibiting finance needs that exceed the constrained cash, calculates the amounts of finance needs above the constraints, identifies the ongoing activities, selects randomly an activity for delaying its start time, determines the impact of the delay on the finance needs, and repeats the procedure until finance feasibility is attained. A 13-activity project was used to demonstrate the proposed repair algorithm. The performance of the repaired-chromosome GA system is evaluated through comparison against replaced-chromosome and penalized-chromosome GA systems using a fairly big project of 210 activities. Finally, the results that were validated using the integer programming technique proved the superior performance of the repaired-chromosome GA in terms of the computational cost and quality of solutions.","[Alghazi, Anas; Selim, Shokri] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Syst Engn, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia; [Elazouni, Ashraf] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Construct Engn & Management Dept, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia","Elazouni, A (corresponding author), King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Construct Engn & Management Dept, POB 346, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia.",alghazi@kfupm.edu.sa; elazouni@kfupm.edu.sa; selim@kfupm.edu.sa,"Selim, Shokri/F-8743-2014","Selim, Shokri/0000-0002-1239-5471; Alghazi, Anas/0000-0003-4757-9606",King Fahd University of Petroleum Minerals [IN080422],"This research was a part of the Research Project No. IN080422 supported by King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, which is greatly acknowledged by the authors.",,20,19,19,0,20,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0887-3801,,,J COMPUT CIVIL ENG,J.

The present study recruited 30 healthy young people (50% male and 50% female) from rural areas of the hot and humid region of China and exposed them to a wide range of temperatures (20-32 degrees C) and humidities (50% and 70%) in a climate chamber. Both the psychological and physiological responses were observed. The thermal neutral standard effective temperature (SET) was determined to be 26.8 degrees C and the 90% thermal acceptable SET range was 22.9-30.7 degrees C. Mean skin temperature and skin wetness were found to be good predictors for thermal comfort in the neutral-cool and neutral-warm conditions, respectively. When compared with the previous results from similar studies of urban participants living in naturally ventilated buildings, a significant divergence is found. Rural participants reported the same thermal sensation but felt more comfortable and acceptable under identical cool or warm conditions. Rural participants had the same neutral temperature, but a much wider acceptable temperature range. The reason for these differences between rural and urban people may be attributed to differences in local culture, expectations and environmental cognition.","[Zhang, Zhongjun; Zhang, Yufeng] South China Univ Technol, Dept Architecture, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jin, Ling] South China Univ Technol, Dept Water Conservancy & Civil Engn, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Zhang, YF (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Dept Architecture, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zhangyuf@scut.edu.cn,,"Zhang, zhongjun/0000-0001-6219-8196; Zhang, Yufeng/0000-0002-5882-1675",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [50708038]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in UniversityProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [NCET-10-0373],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 50708038]; and the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [grant number NCET-10-0373].,,26,15,18,1,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

The objective of this study is to develop a genetic algorithm (GA)-based multiresource leveling model for schedules that are established by LOB. The proposed model postulates that the production rate and duration of an activity are governed by the resource that requires the longest duration in completing a unit. Once the LOB schedule is established, resource leveling is performed according to the principle of optimum crew size that makes use of a utility data curve, which shows that productivity will suffer if the crew size is different than the optimum crew size, and the principle of natural rhythm that allows shifting the start times of an activity forward or backward at different units of production by changing the number of crews employed. The duration of an activity in any one unit and the precedence relationships between activities do not change during the leveling procedure. When applied to the LOB schedule of a pipeline project that was used to illustrate the model, it was observed that the proposed multiresource leveling model provided a smoother resource utilization histogram while maintaining optimum productivity.","[Damci, Atilla; Polat, Gul] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey; [Arditi, David] IIT, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Chicago, IL 60616 USA","Arditi, D (corresponding author), IIT, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Chicago, IL 60616 USA.",damcia@itu.edu.tr; arditi@iit.edu; polatgu@itu.edu.tr,"DAMCI, Atilla/ABB-1420-2020; POLAT, GUL/ABB-3256-2020; Arditi, David/AAF-4608-2021","DAMCI, Atilla/0000-0003-0965-2673; POLAT, GUL/0000-0003-2431-033X; Arditi, David/0000-0002-1580-324X",,,,31,23,23,0,36,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

As part of the resource availability constraints in critical path method (CPM) scheduling, resource calendars may postpone activity start time, extend activity duration, and hence prolong the total project duration. Ultimately, resource calendars bring about changes to the critical path identification. Research has yet to address how to incorporate the effects of multiple resource calendars on the total float determination. In this research, the popular P3 software is used as a tool for investigating the current practice of CPM scheduling under resource limit and calendar constraints. We assess P3's advanced resource scheduling functions (including resource leveling and resource calendars) and identify P3's potential errors in total float determination. Further, we propose a new method based on the forward pass analysis alone for accurately evaluating activity total float subject to resource calendar constraints. The application of the new method is illustrated with an activityon-node case and a precedence-diagram-method case, with the results compared against those produced from P3. Our research has elucidated on some critical issues of resource-constrained scheduling in the application domain of construction project management. The findings will provide useful input for the vendors and users of the CPM software-which is not limited to P3-to improve the scheduling methodology as well as the accuracy of the resulting project schedules.","[Lu, Ming; Lam, Hoi-Ching] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Hong Kong 852, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Lu, M (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Hong Kong 852, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",cemlu@polyu.edu.hk,"Lu, Ming/J-8290-2014",,,,,16,18,20,0,11,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Questionnaire survey data was collected from project management practitioners in Ghana and analyzed using mean scoring, factor analysis, and fuzzy synthetic evaluation. The analysis revealed that the involvement of external stakeholders in decision-making is of topmost rank (mean = 4.717) and effective communication with external stakeholders makes the highest individual contribution (weighting = 1.000). In descending order of contribution based on index values, the seven activity groups established are involving stakeholders and ensuring mutual trust (4.666), effective communication with stakeholders (4.633), sustaining relationships with stakeholders (4.373), preliminary planning (4.006), analyzing project and stakeholder information (3.719), assessing stakeholder attributes and needs (3.675), and developing and applying effective strategies (3.610). Following, an evaluative process model (EPM), which is essentially a practice framework, was developed and demonstrated using the relative weightings of activities. The expert validation results showed that the EPM is comprehensive, objective, reliable, and appropriate for the purpose. The findings contribute to advancing stakeholder theory in construction management research in the context of developing countries. Practitioners can effectively apply, evaluate, compare, and improve the contributing activities in external SM process to inform about needed managerial decisions in projects. The findings will guide practitioners to be more externally oriented, resolve external stakeholder issues proactively, manage project more ethically and sustainably, and improve project success.

Their relationships with supervisors can directly affect their performance, and by extension, project performance and organizational effectiveness. It is thus of utmost importance to investigate the impact of this working relationship on workers' psychological, behavioral, and performance outcomes. Based on data collected from the construction industry in Philippines using a time-lagged research design, this paper investigates the role of supervisor-worker relationships in predicting workers' emotions, job embeddedness, and in-role and extra-role performance. The results reveal that a high-quality working relationship between workers and their supervisors can facilitate workers' positive emotions, leading to enhanced job embeddedness and superior performance. As such, organizations are recommended to equip supervisors with the awareness, knowledge, and skills to facilitate high-quality relationships with their workers. This research contributes to the construction literature by adding empirical evidence to explain whether and why high-quality worker-supervisor relationships actually influence construction workers' performance. It also increases understanding of individual construction employees' performance and well-being from a social-psychological theoretical perspective.

These decisions impact not only the quality of care to patients but also the crucial relationship between the hospital and the physicians who practice there. OR scheduling is typically carried out by highly experienced staff who understand the idiosyncrasies of the particular environment. Due to the complexity of the problem and the dynamic nature of the environment, the effectiveness of general-purpose scheduling systems has been limited in such domains. In this paper, we describe the scheduling problem in a large cardiac center and present a knowledge-based approach for solving the problem. Our system-development efforts were based on an in-depth study of the scheduling problem using a protocol analysis technique. This paper presents a description of the scheduling problem at the cardiac center in the form of a case study and derives a system architecture that integrates principles of opportunistic planning and reason maintenance. The opportunism in our approach allows for incremental schedule construction, while the reason maintenance mechanism ensures that the system keeps track of reasons for scheduling decisions and revises the schedule whenever conflicts or new opportunities for schedule improvement arise.","Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Texas A&M Univ, CBA, GSB, Dept Business Anal & Res, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Arizona State Univ, Sch Accountancy & Informat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Bharadwaj, A (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",,,,,,,54,0,0,1,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394 USA",0018-9391,,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

One of common risk factors is that most cost items of a project are dependent random variables. Thus, correlations between basic cost items need to be considered in predicting the total cost of the project. This paper intends to propose a generic copula-based Monte Carlo simulation method for prediction of construction projects' total costs with dependent cost items. An algorithm to generate the joint probability distribution function of correlated cost items is developed and two examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of copulas in modeling construction costs as random variables. A merit of the proposed method is that it not only can incorporate all different types of distributions in one framework, but it also captures the best dependence structure between variables. This paper finds that different dependence structures can lead to different probability distributions of total cost. It also finds that the existing goodness of fit tests can be employed in choosing the best performing copula. The paper concludes that the copula-based Monte Carlo simulation method can predict total cost of construction projects with reasonable accuracy.","[Firouzi, Afshin] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Construct Engn & Management Grp, Tehran 1477893855, Iran; [Yang, Wei] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Li, Chun-Qing] RMIT Univ, Sch Civil Environm & Chem Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia","Li, CQ (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Civil Environm & Chem Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",firouzi@srbiau.ac.ir; missyangw@163.com; chunqing.li@rmit.edu.au,,"Firouzi, Afshin/0000-0001-7958-7788; Yang, Wei/0000-0002-3673-6488","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP140101547, LP150100413]",Financial support from Australian Research Council under DP140101547 and LP150100413 is gratefully acknowledged.,,21,21,21,0,43,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

In this study, workers and equipment were automatically recognized through object detection from aerial images. Through the case study, this proposed concept was validated to monitor the unsafe activities of workers by four rules established. While the limitations of this study were documented, such as the low number of aerial images to train deep learning model, the low performance of object detection, and the errors that occurred when augmenting the detection results in the game engine, this study also emphasized the potential of the proposed digital ITCP-based safety monitoring system.","[Kim, Kyungki] Univ Nebraska, Durham Sch Architectural Engn & Construct, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Kim, Sungjin] Hanbat Natl Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, 125 Dongseo Daero,S8-321, Deajeon 34158, South Korea; [Shchur, Daniel] Univ Nebraska, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA","Kim, S (corresponding author), Hanbat Natl Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, 125 Dongseo Daero,S8-321, Deajeon 34158, South Korea.",kkim13@unl.edu; sungjinkim@hanbat.ac.kr; dshchur2@unl.edu,,,,,,58,1,1,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

These techniques, principally the cost-schedule integration (CST) model, extensively use project cost estimates and schedule data. Despite CSI models having gained general acceptance, they have not been without criticism. Such criticism includes the problems of differential schedules between network and cost activities, ignoring the important information of payment conditions composed of payment lags, components, and frequency, and the combined adverse effects of payment irregularity and uniform distribution of cost over time. To resolve and alleviate these problems, this study develops a set of cost-payment coordination mechanisms for creating interaction among cost and payment activities. These mechanisms are then developed into a model. The accuracy of the model is assessed by comparing the historical flows on two case projects. The result shows that the patterns of predicted cost flows created with the model closely match those of the historical flows.","[Chen, Wei Tong] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Engn, Yunlin 640, Taiwan; [Chen, Hong Long] Natl Univ Tainan, Dept Business & Management, Tainan 700, Taiwan; [Wei, Nai-Chieh] I Shou Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Kaohsiung 840, Taiwan","Chen, WT (corresponding author), Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Engn, Yunlin 640, Taiwan.",along314@mail.nutn.edu.tw; chenwt@yuntech.edu.tw; newei@isu.edu.tw,"Chen, Wei Tong/G-7452-2019",,"Taiwan National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan",The authors would like to thank Taiwan National Science Council for financially supporting this research.,,30,6,6,0,4,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

A probability model has been prepared to support the functionality of OLAP. A prototype of the cost data management environment, Cost Data Management System (CDMS), has been developed to test the advantage of OLAP in cost estimate. A case study was carried out on the cost estimate of a sample project using the prototype. The results show that the OLAP environment can help understand the uncertainties in construction cost estimate, and provide a way for projecting more reliable construction costs.

Researchers gathered information from 343 residents about their walking behaviours, participation in other activities, health and demographic status, and perceptions of the environment. Field evaluations were conducted to collect objective physical environment measures. Facility information was provided by the administrators. Multivariate hierarchical regression analysis showed significant influences of physical environments on indoor walking behaviours. Indoor recreational walking was related negatively to the number of stories of the building and positively to the perception of looped corridors. Different types of utilitarian walking, such as walk to other activities', walk to front entry' and walk to mailbox' were influenced by specific design features. The number of utilitarian walking types was marginally influenced by the number of stories of the building.

Additionally, the shared entity-based complexity indicators (ECIs), as well as the weighting of entity-based complexity categories were determined and analyzed. Therefore, 101 potential ECIs were identified through a comprehensive literature review. Then, thirteen senior subject matter experts (SMEs), and three academic advisors were selected and invited to participate in a workshop to determine significant ECIs and then rank and weight them. The results reveal that the ECIs associated with complexity categories scope definition and project resources received the highest aggregated complexity weights in the aspect of the primary stakeholders.

As a result of dangerous working environments, construction workers often face safety and health risks throughout the construction process. However, an emphasis on construction safety has increased mainly in the aspect of safety performance, and efforts are required to not only monitor but also seek to improve safety performance. This research develops a safety activity analysis framework and tool to facilitate the collection and analysis of the safety activity data for continuous evaluation of safety performance. A case study is also carried out on an active construction project to implement and validate the framework and tool. The findings of the case study show that the safety index of the construction site increased from 37.0 to 62.8% and was in consonance with the actual site records of the project's total recordable incident rate, which decreased from 7.11 to 1.42. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a methodical and operational safety activity analysis framework that can be used to proactively monitor safety performance, set improvement targets, and provide continuous feedback to enhance safety performance on construction sites. This research also provides a safety activity analysis tool that is a management information system that transforms a laborious and ineffective manual method of collecting and analyzing safety data into a more functional computer-based approach.

Previous studies have suggested that the choice of decision-making strategies is highly related to stakeholders' attributes and behaviors in practice; however, limited studies have been conducted in the construction field to analyze the importance of stakeholders' attributes, behaviors, and decision-making strategies, and validate the correlations between the factors and decision-making strategies. To analyze the underlying meanings of stakeholders' attributes, behaviors, and decision-making strategies from the practitioners' perspectives, and indicate the influence of stakeholder-related factors on decision-making strategies, an interview, questionnaire survey, and case study were adopted. Empirical studies suggest that three stakeholder attributes (power, urgency, and proximity), and four types of stakeholder behaviors (cooperative potential, competitive threat, opposite position, and neutral attitude) are perceived by the practitioners as important to dealing with stakeholder claims. Depending on stakeholders' salience levels and behavior types, strategies of defense, compromise, or concession/adaptation are chosen and applied by project managers in practice. The findings can help project managers to proactively understand stakeholder performance, place emphasis on particular attributes and behaviors, and formulate appropriate schemes under different circumstances.","[Yang, Rebecca J.] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Wang, Yaowu] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Jin, Xiao-Hua] Univ Western Sydney, SCEM, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia","Yang, RJ (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",rebecca.yang@mit.edu.au; ywwang@hit.edu.cn; xinhua.jin@uws.edu.au,"Jin, Xiao-Hua/N-1483-2018","Jin, Xiao-Hua/0000-0003-0877-9533; Yang, Rebecca/0000-0002-0418-1967",,,,68,38,38,1,58,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",8756-9728,1938-9507,,PROJ MANAG J,Proj.

However, its full functions are yet to be explored for the performance of government-sponsored infrastructure projects due to the inherent complexities and uncertainties that arise from their unique socioeconomic perspective in developing countries. Therefore, this research investigates the dimensions of project governance (i.e., portfolio direction; sponsorship effectiveness and efficiency; and disclosure and reporting) effects on project performance through the correlation of stakeholder management. Based on the stakeholder theory, a moderation model was proposed and a survey questionnaire was designed to get feedback from the respondents of the government policy and planning departments of Pakistan. Structural equation modeling was the core statistical technique for testing the hypotheses. The findings of moderation analysis show that project governance has a positive relation with project performance at medium and higher regression coefficients values of stakeholder management. Inversely, at low regression values, this relationship is negative and insignificant. This research contributes to the literature as the significant interaction of stakeholder management could amplify the effect of project governance, subsequently enhancing the performance of public infrastructure projects.","[Khan, Asadullah] Karakoram Int Univ, Dept Business Management, Gilgit 15100, Pakistan; [Waris, Muhammad] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Ind Management, Gambang 26300, Pahang, Malaysia; [Panigrahi, Shrikant] Univ Buraimi, Coll Business, POB 890, Alburaimi 512, Oman; [Sajid, Mirza Rizwan] Univ Gujrat, Dept Stat, Gujrat 50700, Punjab, Pakistan; [Rana, Faisal] Amer Univ Dubai, Sch Business Adm, POB 28282, Dubai, U Arab Emirates","Waris, M (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Ind Management, Gambang 26300, Pahang, Malaysia.",asad@kiu.edu.pk; waris@ump.edu.my; shrikant@uob.edu.om; mirzarizwansajid@gmail.com; frana@aud.edu,"Khan, Asadullah/AAQ-9782-2020; Sajid, Rizwan/AAW-7510-2021","Khan, Asadullah/0000-0003-1423-6439; Sajid, Rizwan/0000-0002-0358-2195; Rana, Faisal/0000-0001-7849-0482",,,,142,3,3,56,65,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

However, there is no consensus on the relative severity of various causes of delay because severity may change with respect to project characteristics, such as the type of project and/or procurement type. Public-private partnership (PPP) has been utilized extensively in recent years, and the number of public construction works worldwide that adopted the PPP has increased gradually. However, the delay causes specific to PPPs have not been investigated deeply. Moreover, the perceptions of different stakeholders on causes of delay in PPP projects have never been investigated, although the perception difference between stakeholders is considered an important issue in delay management. In this study, the perceptions of three key stakeholdersnamely, consultants, the private sector, and the public sectoron delay causes in build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects performed in Turkey, which is one of the leading countries in terms of number of PPP projects and the total value of PPP projects, were investigated. The delay causes specific to BOT projects were evaluated by conducting a workshop to determine the causes of delay in the Turkish market. The identified delay causes were evaluated using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) by 11 participants who represent consultants, the private sector, and the public sector. The correlations between the respondents were evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This study showed that the most important delay causes are related to the uncertainties and changes. In particular, private sector participants emphasized the importance of certainty on political and governmental issues and minimization of changes in design to avoid delays in BOT projects. In contrast, the respondents from the public sector proposed that a detailed feasibility study and preliminary plan should be prepared and the transfer stage should be planned carefully. Finally, different perceptions were observed among the stakeholders at the stages where the collaboration of the stakeholders is limited.","[Budayan, Cenk] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34220 Esenler, Turkey","Budayan, C (corresponding author), Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34220 Esenler, Turkey.",budayan@yildiz.edu.tr,"budayan, cenk/AAC-1901-2020","budayan, cenk/0000-0002-8433-2824",,,,54,22,22,12,73,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

This study applies catastrophe theory to model the contractors' learning behavior in response to feedback. An industry survey was conducted in Hong Kong for data collection. To test the conceptual model, Cusp fit program was employed. The results indicate that not until they perform worse than the client's anticipation, the contractors may not practice double-loop learning as a response to the project monitoring feedback.

Due to the high accident rates in the construction industry it is vital for management to take necessary steps to implement programs and procedures that will increase construction safety and worker productivity. While the effects of a drug-related jobsite accident can be catastrophic for individuals and companies, management should realize that drug use among employees can be damaging to moral, productivity, and quality even if it does not result in accidents. The level of teamwork required for excellent work is harder to achieve and efforts to improve project management by team building are hurt by the absenteeism and short-term employment typical of the employee that abuses drugs. Other areas where the project management of a construction company is compromised by worker drug use are recruitment and retention of human resources, career growth management, and safety. Drug testing construction workers is an effective method for reducing the number of impaired workers on a project site, increasing overall project safety, worker morale, productivity, and profits.

In general, construction participants make a stipulation regarding their roles and responsibilities by contracting in order to prevent such claims and disputes. A common practice for preparing construction contracts is to modify the standard contract forms to reflect the interests of the given project from the owner's perspective. In this process, however, favorable clauses that may be beneficial to the contractor are often modified or even removed, causing significant potential risks to the contractor. Therefore, an in-depth review of contract terms and conditions is required to avoid future risks. This study presents a new proactive risk assessment model to identify missing contractor-friendly clauses in the owner's modified contract conditions from the contractor's point of view. A case study is used to demonstrate the proposed framework, and real-world project cases were analyzed to understand what type of contractor-friendly clauses would likely be omitted in the owner's modified contract. In this study, the developed model builds on rule-based natural-language processing (NLP) to analyze unstructured text data through preprocessing, syntactic analysis, and semantic analysis. The proposed data-driven risk assessment model is expected to reduce the extent of human errors by (1) identifying potential contractual risks that could arise disputes; and (2) supporting to develop an appropriate response strategy for the given risks.","[Lee, JeeHee; Ham, Youngjib] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, 3137 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Yi, June-Seong; Son, JeongWook] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Architectural & Urban Syst Engn, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea","Yi, JS (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Architectural & Urban Syst Engn, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea.",jhlee04@tamu.edu; yham@tamu.edu; jsyi@ewha.ac.kr; jwson@ewha.ac.kr,,"Lee, Jeehee/0000-0002-5944-3848","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2018R1D1A1A09083708, NRF-2018R1A6A3A01012406]",This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2018R1D1A1A09083708 and NRF-2018R1A6A3A01012406).,,43,10,10,8,21,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

The central hypothesis of this study is that it is possible to eliminate injuries if we move the human construction worker off-site and remotely link his/her motions to a Robotic Construction Worker (RCW) on-site. As a first steppingstone towards this ultimate goal, two systems essential for the RCW were developed in this study. First, a novel system that combines 3D body and hand position tracking was developed to capture the movements of human construction worker. This combination of tracking enables the capture of changes in the orientations and articulations of the entire human body. Second, a real-time simulation system that connects a human construction worker off-site to a virtual RCW was developed to demonstrate the proposed concept in a variety of construction scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate the future viability of the RCW concept and indicate the promise of this system for eliminating the health and safety risks faced by human construction workers.","[Kurien, Manoj; Kopsida, Marianna; Brilakis, Ioannis] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Trumpington St, Cambridge, England; [Kim, Min-Koo] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Kim, MK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",minkoo.kim@polyu.edu.hk,"Brilakis, Ioannis/H-5369-2013; Kim, Minkoo/O-4727-2017","Brilakis, Ioannis/0000-0003-1829-2083; Kim, Minkoo/0000-0003-2134-0031",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/N021614/1] Funding Source: researchfish,,,32,23,24,2,72,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Every green building project (GBP) involves numerous stakeholders and potentially incompatible concerns. Despite the associated environmental, economic and social benefits, GBP developments have often confronted managerial barriers which are actually emerged from stakeholders - the actual key determinants of a project. Holistically analyzing the complexity of stakeholders in GBPs is, therefore, crucial to improving GBP management and achieving greater sustainability for all involved. The purpose of this paper is to analyze stakeholder complexity in large GBPs using a holistic framework which integrates both empirical and rationalistic analytical perspectives. Design/methodology/approach The complexity of stakeholders in GBPs can be considered from three aspects - identifying stakeholders, assessing stakeholder interactions and analyzing stakeholder concerns. The proposed stakeholder analysis framework uses both empirical methods (e.g. interviews and surveys) and rationalistic methods (e.g. chain referral sampling and social network analysis) to analyze GBP stakeholder complexity. Case study of a lab-enabled commercial GBP in Hong Kong was undertaken to illustrate the framework. Findings The framework enables a holistic, objective and effective stakeholder analysis; leading GBP leaders toward a complete understanding of project stakeholder complexity. The case study findings bring managerial insights to GBP leaders on the general SNA-related stakeholder dynamics and the important stakeholder concerns, of large Hong Kong GBPs. The findings diagnose general connectivity structures of GBP stakeholders, identify influential and peripheral actors in GBP information exchange, and suggest clues to improve their dynamics. In addition, ten key stakeholder concerns were identified, including comprehensive governmental standards and procedures, clear sustainability goals at the outset, effective stakeholder engagement, adequate design flexibility, and a can-do attitude of contractors and consultants - which are all vital for successful GBP development. The underlying reasons of these concerns and recommendations to addressing them were also discussed. Originality/value Many existing GBP stakeholder studies appear to use a single analytical perspective to assess project stakeholder complexity, but this may not gain a full understanding. The holistic stakeholder analysis framework used herein combines empiricism and rationalism.

The desire for more efficient and effective PPP projects renders the performance management to be increasingly important, in which the influence of the stakeholders must be considered. To implement complete and effective performance management in PPP projects, 15 performance objective attributes are proposed based on the perspectives of different stakeholders. A structured questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the relative significance of each attribute in four stakeholder groups. According to the survey results, the objective attributes are all important. Integrating all stakeholders' benefits and selecting the appropriate qualitative level of performance objective in the process of decision making are two particularly important problems because of stakeholders' different preferences. To resolve these problems, a fuzzy entropy method and a fuzzy TOPSIS method based on projection distance have been developed to calculate the final decision weights in all stakeholder groups and select appropriate performance objective levels for PPP projects, respectively. The final decision weights are obtained using fuzzy entropy to integrate the experiences and knowledge of all stakeholders. An illustrative case Study on the Beijing National Stadium project for the 2008 Olympic Games is used to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed model.","[Yuan, Jingfeng; Li, Qiming; Zheng, Lei] Southeast Univ, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Yuan, JF (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.",jfyuan@seu.edu.cn; mirek@umd.edu; njlqming@163.com; zllaowu@sina.com,"Skibniewski, Miroslaw J./P-5310-2018","Yuan, Jingfeng/0000-0002-0922-6853; Skibniewski, Miroslaw/0000-0002-7102-753X",,,,53,63,65,4,168,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Although in the construction industry the competency requirements for mid- and upper-level employees are very well defined, such clear definitions at the workers' level are missing. Literature suggests that along with practical skills, workers require additional socioemotional, cognitive, and technical competencies to perform their work efficiently. Therefore, through a nationwide survey of 598 industrial professionals in India, 6, 9, and 13 competencies were identified for unskilled, semiskilled, and skilled categories of workers, respectively. These competencies included attitude, motivation, and physical strength for unskilled workers; self-confidence and technical knowledge for semiskilled workers; and writing, reading, mathematical, and problem-solving skills for skilled workers. These results will have threefold implications. First, they will assist training providers designing an effective worker training program. Second, they will help the development of a career progression path for the workers. Third, if the identified competencies are considered in workers' categorization process, then the latter will become more robust than the existing one, in which only practical skills are considered.","[Johari, Sparsh; Jha, Kumar Neeraj] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110016, India","Johari, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110016, India.",sparshjo@gmail.com; knjha@civil.iitd.ac.in,,"Johari, Sparsh/0000-0002-1396-0188",,,,57,1,1,4,4,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The findings show that interruptions have a negative impact on worker performance when they occur at the middle or end of the current/primary task. In addition, results show that the majority of the interruptions were externally generated (78%) rather than internally generated. The more demanding the tasks that were interrupted, the greater the negative impact on the overall performance.

HIV prevalence in South Africa is among the highest in the world, with the construction industry especially affected, yet little is known about condom use by construction workers and the determinants thereof. Data were gathered from 512 site-based workers in the Western Cape. A theoretical model explaining condom use as a function of demographic factors, HIV knowledge, substance usage and risky sexual behaviour (excluding condom use) was proposed and tested using regression and structural equations modelling. The findings indicated that age, gender and level of education were indirect determinants of condom use, with higher levels of education predicting better AIDS-related knowledge. Higher levels of risky sexual behaviour were associated with more frequent use of condoms, suggesting greater awareness of risk. Condom use was adversely affected by greater alcohol and drug use, probably as a result of diminished capacity to assess risk. Finally, lower and not higher levels of AIDS-related knowledge were associated with better condom use, suggesting that improved knowledge of HIV transmission may work contrary to safe sex practice if it lulls the person into a false sense of confidence.

Although extremely accurate cost predictions are difficult, information generated through historical cost analyses, along with a study of the factors that determine these costs, could contribute greatly to improving the accuracy of such predictions. In the research described, 14 university facilities and eight government offices were investigated. Quantitative data on the historical operating and maintenance costs of these facilities, along with knowledge of the factors affecting the costs were elicited through various sources. Cost prediction models were developed using neural networks, regression analyses, and random deviation detection methods. The final stage of the research was the creation of a costs prediction decision-support system using the analytical results and the knowledge acquired.

Failing to address and meet the concerns and expectations of the stakeholders involved has resulted in many project failures. One way to address this issue is through a participatory approach to project decision making. Whether the participation mechanism is effective or not depends largely on the client/owner. This paper provides a means of systematically evaluating the effectiveness of the public participation exercise, or even the whole project, through the measurement of stakeholder satisfaction. Since the process of satisfaction measurement is complicated and uncertain, requiring approximate reasoning involving human intuition, a fuzzy approach is adopted. From this, a multi-factor hierarchical fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is established to facilitate the evaluation of satisfaction in both single stakeholder group and overall MIC project stakeholders.

In addition to the importance of detailed project planning, faultless production, and optimal working conditions in dam constructions, it is equally important to identify and analyze the risks from the occupational health and safety (OHS) perspective that may arise during construction and operation. In this context, hazard identification, risk analysis, and control, which are the main issues of dam safety, have gained importance. In this study, a novel approach is developed for dam construction safety. Two newly proposed multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods of Best-Worst Method-BWM and measurement of alternatives and ranking to Compromise solution-MARCOS, are merged under the context of interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs). Severity and probability, two essential parameters of the risk score, have been weighted using BWM. Subsequently, the priority orders of hazards have been determined by the MARCOS. In implementing the approach to the blasting process in dam construction, several control measures are suggested for stakeholders. Some comparative works and sensitivity analyses are performed to test the approach's validity and solidity from the methodological viewpoint.","[Celik, Erkan] Istanbul Univ, Dept Transportat & Logist, TR-34322 Istanbul, Turkey; [Gul, Muhammet] Munzur Univ, Dept Emergency Aid & Disaster Management, TR-62000 Tunceli, Turkey","Gul, M (corresponding author), Munzur Univ, Dept Emergency Aid & Disaster Management, TR-62000 Tunceli, Turkey.",erkancelik@istanbul.edu.tr; muhammetgul@munzur.edu.tr,,,,,,60,3,3,22,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

In the past two decades, the AEC community has examined different approaches, including virtual and augmented reality, to improve communication, visualization, and coordination among different project participants; yet these approaches are slowly being adopted by the industry. Such technological advancements have the potential to improve and revolutionize the current approaches in design (e.g., by involving end-user feedback to ensure higher performing building operations and end-user satisfaction), in construction (e.g., by improving safety through virtual training), and in operations (e.g., by visualizing real-time sensor data to improve diagnostics). The authors' research vision builds upon the value of using immersive virtual environments (IVEs) during the design, construction, and operation phases of AEC projects. IVEs could provide a sense of presence found in physical mock-ups and make evaluation of an increased set of potential design alternatives possible in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Yet, in order to use IVEs during the design, construction, and operation phases of buildings, it is important to ensure that the data collected and analyzed in such environments represent physical environments. To test whether IVEs are adequate representations of physical environments and to measure user performance in such environments, this paper presents results from an experiment that investigates user performance on a set of everyday office-related activities (e.g., reading text and identifying objects in an office environment) and benchmarks the participants' performance in a similar physical environment. Sense of presence is also measured within an IVE through a set of questionnaires. By analyzing the experimental data from 112 participants, the authors concluded that the participants perform similarly in an NE setting as they do in the benchmarked physical environment for all of the measured tasks. The questionnaire data show that the participants felt a strong sense of presence within an NE. Based on the experimental data, the authors thus demonstrate that an NE can be an effective tool in the design phase of AEC projects in order to acquire end-user performance feedback, which might lead to higher performing infrastructure design and end-user satisfaction.

Practice expressed the need for getting more insight into the development of the estimated costs of the projects in the preconstruction phase. This paper, therefore, discusses the estimate of the total project costs (and cost contingency) in the preconstruction phases of 29 Dutch flood defense projects using a case study approach. Altogether, the projects have experienced an 11.51% increase in the estimated costs compared to the initial estimates, which is low compared to previous studies. This increase in the cost estimates of the flood defense projects can be explained by technical reasons. The investigation of known unknowns and unknown unknowns contingencies shows that the percentage of the unknown unknowns contingency has increased in the preconstruction phase while a reduction was expected. This increase suggests that the projects were not confident about their estimates and the increase can be explained by a lack of experience, organizations' culture, or the phenomenon of pessimistic bias. Practitioners can avoid pessimistic bias behavior by asking for opinions about their estimates and using historical project data. Further research is suggested into realized cost contingency after project execution.","[Hoseini, Erfan] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Infrastruct Design & Management, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Bosch-Rekveldt, Marian] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Infrastruct Design & Management, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Project Management, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Hertogh, Marcel] Delft Univ Technol, Res Grp Infrastructu Design & Management, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands","Hoseini, E (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Infrastruct Design & Management, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",e.hoseini@tudelft.nl; M.G.C.Bosch-Rekveldt@tudelft.nl; M.J.C.M.Hertogh@tudelft.nl,,"Bosch-Rekveldt, Marian/0000-0001-9309-6352",Hoogwaterbeschermingsprogramma (HWBP),The authors would like to thank Hoogwaterbeschermingsprogramma (HWBP) for funding this research and providing the project documents used in this research.,,48,3,3,6,19,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Specifically, the effect of perceived COVID-19 safety risk (PCSR) on SB, the interacting (moderating) effect of firm size (FS) on the relationship between PCSR and SB, and the mechanism through which PCSR leads to SB through the firm's safety climate (SC) were examined for a sample of 312 construction site workers in Nigeria. The partial least squares structural equation modeling technique was used to analyze the data. The results indicate that PCSR has no significant effect on SB. SC fully mediated the effect of PCSR on SB, while FS moderated the relationship between PCSR and SB, with a stronger effect observed for small firms. It is recommended that a deliberate effort should be made to inculcate a change in the behavior of workers in small firms because of the inverse relationship between PCSR and SB in such firms. This study's findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge by equipping construction project managers and engineers with much-required information to create a good SC aimed at fostering an acceptable level of SB among construction workers in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 on construction sites. The study also advances the academic literature on health and safety performance in the construction sector, particularly during pandemics such as COVID-19.","[Onubi, Hilary Omatule; Yusof, Nor'Aini; Hassan, Ahmad Sanusi] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Housing Bldg & Planning, George Town 11800, Malaysia","Onubi, HO (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Housing Bldg & Planning, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",onubihilary@gmail.com; ynoraini@usm.my; sanusi@usm.my,"Onubi, Hilary Omatule/P-7772-2018; Yusof, Nor'Aini/A-7093-2011","Onubi, Hilary Omatule/0000-0001-5353-1276; Yusof, Nor'Aini/0000-0002-8943-6868",Universiti Sains Malaysia through the Graduate on Time Incentive [1001/PPBGN/821054],The authors sincerely acknowledge the financial support from Universiti Sains Malaysia through the Graduate on Time Incentive (Grant No. 1001/PPBGN/821054).,,78,0,0,2,2,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

While approaches exist for one-dimensional network schedules, two-dimensional linear and repetitive schedules that track both work and time lack such a method. Fuzzy logic can express variability by modeling optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic cases, which, in this study, form a cone of expected activity durations. Previous studies attempted to apply it to linear and repetitive schedules but suffered from inconsistencies that rendered their results incorrect. Therefore, this research proposes a new fuzzy scheduling method. Its contribution is threefold. First, it models linear or segmental activities as continuous yet flexible fuzzy cones. Second, it explicitly expresses continuous buffers in both the time and work/space dimensions to compose an efficient schedule from such inputs. Third, it identifies their full or partial fuzzy criticality and fuzzy float so that managers can split their attention accordingly. It is illustrated by a validation example, which also explains prior inconsistencies. The industry thus gains a new method that considers uncertainty to generate stable and efficient schedules.

First, the scheduling module uses a resource-driven scheduling algorithm to develop practical schedules for repetitive construction projects. Second, the optimization module utilizes multiobjective genetic algorithms to search for and identify feasible construction plans that establish optimal tradeoffs between project duration and crew work continuity.

In addition, traditional stochastic methods may also suffer from not being able to produce satisfactorily leveled schedules. Therefore, there is a pressing need for new procedures that are capable of dealing with resource leveling subject to uncertainties. The writers study the resource leveling problem subject to activity durations uncertainty where the usage of renewable resources needs to be leveled over time. Two heuristics for producing scheduling policies are presented with the objective of minimizing the expected sum of the weighted coefficient of variation of the resource usage. The two heuristics represent two different ways of tackling the stochastic resource leveling problem. The first heuristic, a modified version of the Burgess and Killebrew leveling procedure, obtains a scheduling policy by solving the deterministic equivalent of the stochastic resource leveling problem. The second heuristic, a simulation-based tabu search procedure, directly works with the stochastic resource leveling problem. Computational experiments are conducted on the well-known project scheduling problem library (PSPLIB) J90 instances.

Paradoxically, resource-related issues are frequently ignored even though they can affect project completion time, too. The research presented here shows that delay analysis without resource allocation practice substantially affects results of schedule analysis. Some delay can cause unrealistic resource allocation in downstream work, which in turn may further delay the project. The effect of resource allocation can either add to or reduce the severity of some delaying event. Apportionment of delay responsibility may be inaccurate unless resource allocation practice is considered in the analysis. Practical and necessary steps are proposed to enhance the existing window analysis technique. A case study is presented to compare the enhanced window analysis with the existing window analysis. This research enables practitioners to make delay analyses and claims more practical and reliable. Further studies are needed to improve the usability, credibility, and acceptability of schedule analysis considering resource allocation.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Ibbs, W (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",drcwibbs@aol.com; duylong@berkeley.edu,,,,,,37,23,23,0,3,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Design/methodology/approach The model consists of four modules. The first module quantifies uncertainties associated with the crew productivity rate and quantity of work using the fuzzy set theory. The second module identifies feasible boundaries for activity relaxation. The third module computes direct cost, indirect cost and interruption costs, including idle crew cost as well as mobilization and demobilization costs. The fourth module identifies near-optimum crew formation using a newly developed multi-objective optimization model. Findings The developed model was able to provide improvements of 0.2, 16.86 and 12.98% for minimization of project cost, crew work interruptions and interruption costs from US$1,505,960, 8.3 days and US$8,300, as recently reported in the literature, to US$1,502,979, 6.9 days and US$7,222, respectively, without impacting the optimized project duration. Originality/value The novelty of this paper lies in its activity-relaxation free float that considers the effect of postponing early finish dates of repetitive activities on crew work interruptions. The introduced new float allows for calculating the required crew productivity rate that minimizes crew work interruptions without delaying successor activities and without impacting the optimized project duration. It safeguards against assignment of unnecessary costly resources.","[Roghabadi, Mohammadjavad Arabpour; Moselhi, Osama] Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn BCEE, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Roghabadi, MA (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn BCEE, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",mohammadjavad.arabpour@concordia.ca,"Roghabadi, Mohammadjavad Arabpour/ABI-2303-2020","Arabpour Roghabadi, Mohammadjavad/0000-0002-3924-8375","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) EngageNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [N01729, N00807]; Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science, Concordia University [VE0010]","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial supports from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Engage (Grants N01729 and N00807) and Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science, Concordia University (Grant VE0010).",,57,1,1,2,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

The primary advantage of LOB is maintaining work continuity, which leads to maximizing learning development effect and minimizing idle time of crews. While LOB is basically applicable to repetitive projects, learning development effect that naturally inherent with repetition is usually ignored. Several mathematical models, or learning curves, have been developed to investigate variation in productivity as a function of the number of units produced. The most practical and used one is the straight-line model. In this paper, learning development effect is incorporated into traditional LOB scheduling. The basic equation of LOB technique has been modified to consider learning development effect, in which straight-line learning curve model is adopted. An example project is used to demonstrate model calculations and obtained results are then analyzed. The developed model has been applied on a real-life project in order to demonstrate its applicability and practicality. Incorporating learning development effect into LOB scheduling provides for more realistic forecast of repetitive projects duration and/or cost. The proposed model provides both academics and practitioners with an effective tool for scheduling repetitive projects based on realistic assumptions.","[Ammar, Mohammad A.; Abdel-Maged, Amena F.] Tanta Univ, Fac Engn, Struct Engn Dept, Tanta, Egypt; [Ammar, Mohammad A.] Kingdom Univ, Coll Architectural Engn & Design, Riffa, Bahrain","Ammar, MA (corresponding author), Tanta Univ, Fac Engn, Struct Engn Dept, Tanta, Egypt.; Ammar, MA (corresponding author), Kingdom Univ, Coll Architectural Engn & Design, Riffa, Bahrain.",m.ammar@ku.edu.bh,,,,,,28,7,7,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

Nevertheless, the inverse is mooted, that high levels of safety has had a negative impact on productivity in construction. This possibility is discussed in the context of government rhetoric which tends to be highly critical of construction's economic shortcomings yet quite silent on the matter of its safety successes.

However, the progression by which safety culture affects safety performance has not yet been examined. Also, how safety culture affects the overall safety performance at different levels of the organization is yet to be explored. In order to address this issue, the purpose of this paper is to study the effect of multilevel safety culture upon safety performance over time.

Considering the dynamic nature and intricacy of the safety management system, the system dynamics approach has been employed to develop the model. Findings The results indicate that the safety culture at the tactical level (middle management) and operational level is much more effective than strategic level (top management) in ameliorating the safety performance of the organization. Originality/value This paper presents the holistic view of multilevel safety culture in an organization's hierarchy. It shows how multilevel level safety culture in an organization interacts with the safety management system to enhance the safety performance of the organization.","[Qayoom, Abdul] Asian Inst Technol, Dept Construct Engn & Infrastruct Management, Bangkok, Thailand; [Qayoom, Abdul] Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Jamshoro, Pakistan; [Hadikusumo, Bonaventura H.

Few studies have used geographic information systems coupled with infrastructure vulnerability models to explore how spatial accessibility to goods and services shifts after a hurricane. Models that explore spatial accessibility to health services are particularly lacking. This study provides a framework to examine how the disruption of transportation networks during and after a hurricane can impact a resident's ability to access health services over time. Two different bridge-closure conditions-inundation and structural failure-along with roadway inundation are used to quantify posthurricane accessibility at short- and long-term temporal scales. Inundation may close a bridge for hours or days, but a structural failure may close a route for weeks or months. Both forms of closure are incorporated using probabilistic vulnerability models coupled with GIS-based models to assess spatial accessibility in the aftermath of a coastal hazard. Harris County, an area in southeastern Texas prone to coastal hazards, is used as a case study. The results indicate changes in the accessibility scores of specific areas depending on the temporal scale of interest and intensity of the hazard scenario. Sociodemographic indicators are also examined for the study region, revealing the populations most likely to suffer from lack of accessibility. Overall, the presented framework helps to understand how both short-term functionality loss and long-term damage affect access to critical services such as healthcare after a hazard. This information, in turn, can shape decisions about future mitigation and planning efforts, and the presented framework can be expanded to other hazard-prone areas.

Recent studies have shown that many construction fatalities are related to design and could have been avoided with proper design considerations. Nevertheless, designers have limited knowledge about construction safety and often are unable to identify how their designs may pose a risk during the life cycle of a building facility such as construction, operation and maintenance. Limited effort has been made to help designer to address these safety issues in the design phase. This study presents a structured DfS rule-based knowledge library to provide safety knowledge to designer. Using the DfS knowledge library, an Intelligent BIM-integrated risk review system is proposed to help designers identify risk related to their design element along with required design features. A risk register system is also developed in the BIM platform to follow up for any residual risk. The proposed risk review system has been examined with an illustrative case project. It is found that many of the risks could have been avoided/eliminated with the DfS knowledge library and intelligent risk review system early in the design phase. Thus, it would help to avoid any unexpected delay or costly design change late in the project to mitigate the risk.","[Hossain, Md. Aslam; Abbott, Ernest L.

Design/methodology/approach The design of the developed method is based on integrating six modules: uncertainty and defuzzification module using fuzzy set theory, schedule calculations module using the integration of linear scheduling method (LSM) and critical chain project management (CCPM), cost calculations module that considers direct and indirect costs, delay penalty, and work interruptions cost, multi-objective optimization module using Evolver (c) 7.5.2 as a genetic algorithm (GA) software, module for identifying multiple critical sequences and schedule buffers, and reporting module. Findings For duration optimization that utilizes fuzzy inputs without interruptions or adding buffers, duration and cost generated by the developed method are found to be 90 and 99 percent of those reported in the literature, respectively. For cost optimization that utilizes fuzzy inputs without interruptions, project duration generated by the developed method is found to be 93 percent of that reported in the literature after adding buffers.

However, when considered in depth, internal aspects of 4D scheduling techniques have not made significant advances from traditional two-dimensional (2D) scheduling. What is missing from 4D scheduling? Why has the interaction between activities, their relationships, and three-dimensional (3D) components not been flexible and adaptive enough? In light of these questions, this paper analyzes the current state of 4D scheduling. The missing element in 4D scheduling is found to be 4D relationships (4DRs). A prototype of 4DRs has therefore been developed to improve 4D scheduling. Finally, guidance on the application of 4DRs in 4D scheduling is presented to help the users come to a thorough understanding of its advantages and disadvantages and potential applications.

Most scheduling methods based on the critical path method (CPM) require that all project constraints be comprehensively defined and arranged into a single logical network for developing a project schedule. In real-life situations, however, there could be more than one option of execution, conditions, and/or precautions that may influence the logic of the project network and its outputs. CPM-based methods have been proven inadequate for scheduling in this kind of situation. This paper views construction scheduling as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), which is defined by a set of scheduling variables and a set of constraints. A CSP-based scheduling method has been developed to provide a framework for systematic constraint modeling and effective schedule generation. An illustrative real-life case example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. The results indicate that the present method is effective and efficient due to its expressive constraint representations and its ability to provide alternative schedules for multilogic project networks. This resembles more the nature of construction projects in which various types of constraints both conditional and unconditional are involved and many scheduling options can be derived. Comparing with the traditional CPM-based methods, the proposed method has the potential to transform the way construction schedules are generated and managed. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000582.

Design/methodology/approach The proposed method utilizes fuzzy set theory (FSs) for modeling uncertainties associated with activities' duration and cost and genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing project schedule. The method has four main modules that support two optimization methods: modeling uncertainty and defuzzification module; scheduling module; cost calculations module; and decision-support module. The first optimization method uses the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), while the second uses a dynamic weighted optimization genetic algorithm. The developed scheduling and optimization methods are coded in python as a stand-alone automated computerized tool to facilitate the developed method's application. Findings The developed method is applied to a numerical example to demonstrate its use and illustrate its capabilities. The method was validated using a multi-layered comparative analysis that involves performance evaluation, statistical comparisons and stability evaluation. Results indicated that NSGA-II outperformed the weighted optimization method, resulting in a better global optimum solution, which avoided local minima entrapment. Moreover, the developed method was constructed under a deterministic scenario to evaluate its performance in finding optimal solutions against the previously developed literature methods. Results showed the developed method's superiority in finding a better optimal set of solutions in a reasonable processing time.

This paper presents the development of a multiobjective scheduling optimization model for multiple construction projects using the fast elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The purpose of the proposed model is to obtain optimal trade-offs between different projects' objectives. The scheduling optimization model comprises submodels of project scheduling, resource allocation and leveling, and cash flow forecasting.

It provides a generic representation schema and a systematic reasoning framework to capture, reason and convert functional requirements into temporal constraints between schedule elements. FReMAS is implemented in (ECLPSe)-P-i, and an illustrative example of a nursing building construction is employed to demonstrate its application. FReMAS automatically determines possible sequences and generates all schedule alternatives that satisfy all imposed construction requirements while minimizing the project makespan. With the capability of automatic sequencing and alternative scheduling, FReMAS can help improve the effectiveness and adequacy of the planning process. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, most of these studies only consider single-skilled crews working on linear projects, neglecting the flexibility of multi-skilling in construction. Recently, researchers have revealed that multi-skilling in construction can lead to increased productivity, flexibility, and work continuity. Therefore, this study proposes a duration optimization model while introducing the concept of multi-skilling to integrate single/multiple-skilled crews to improve work performance. Moreover, to enhance the efficiency of problem solving, constraint programming (CP) is used to handle complicated combinatorial scheduling problems, and several heuristic rules involving schedules are engaged. The CP-based optimization minimizes project duration while two crew types, including single-skilled and multi-skilled crews, are integrated in the proposed model.

Critical path identification is a major attribute for both methods; therefore, it is very important for practitioners to understand the function of the two methods in this area. The present paper compares the critical path of the recently developed Kallantzis-Lambropoulos repetitive project model against the network scheduling critical path method (CPM), aiming at delving into and pointing out the differences and similarities between them. Initially, the rules for transforming the linear project into an equivalent CPM network are proposed. Then, the rules are applied on a sample linear project. Due to the additional constraint for maintaining resource continuity that the linear method takes into account, the critical paths vary. The constraint is subsequently removed from selected activities and comparison is repeated; the critical paths then coincide. In order to validate the findings and ensure impartiality of results, a random linear project generator is developed. A group of twenty-five random linear projects and their equivalent networks is produced. Their critical paths are analyzed, compared and classified. Conclusions support that the proposed comparison could be beneficial to users of linear scheduling methods, while the random project generator can serve other related research.","NTUA, Athens 14561, Greece; NTUA, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Athens 15770, Greece; NTUA, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Athens 15770, Greece","Kallantzis, A (corresponding author), NTUA, 265 Kifissias Ave, Athens 14561, Greece.",,,,,,,15,19,24,1,12,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

There have also been limited studies focusing on how site employees' perceptions could be affected by multiple external and internal factors such as workers' experience levels. This study firstly developed a theoretical safety cognition framework addressing site employees' perceptions toward hazards. Empirical data from construction safety reports in China were collected to quantify and define eight common safety hazard or accident scenarios. Following the empirical data analysis, these eight hazards were ranked in terms of their occurrence, severity, and controllability. Based on the results of questionnaires received in China's construction industry, site employees' perceptions toward these eight hazards were analyzed, ranked, and compared with the empirical ranking. Major findings included but were not limited to: (1) hazards with higher occurrences tended to be perceived with less deviation; (2) more experienced employees were more likely to apply prior scenarios and safety knowledge to perceiving given hazards and to have more reliable perceptions; and (3) prior scenarios might also create biased perceptions in the case of electrocution. The current study contributed to the knowledge in safety climate by proposing and testing the framework incorporating safety perceptions. Further research could be performed to explore more subgroup factors' effects on workers' perceptions, as well as how to design an effective safety training program to correct their biased perceptions.","[Han, Yu; Yin, Zhenzhen] Jiangsu Univ, Fac Civil Engn & Mech, 301 Xuefu Rd, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jialun] Jiangsu Univ, Fac Management, 301 Xuefu Rd, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jin, Ruoyu] Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Cockcroft Bldg 616, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England; [Gidado, Kassim; Painting, Noel] Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Cockcroft Bldg, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England; [Yang, Yang] Chongqing Univ, MOE Key Lab New Technol Construct Cities Mt Area, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yang] Chongqing Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Yan, Libo] Fraunhofer Wilhelm Klauditz Inst WKI, Ctr Light & Environm Friendly Struct, Bienroder Weg 54E, D-38102 Braunschweig, Germany","Jin, RY (corresponding author), Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Cockcroft Bldg 616, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England.",hanyu85@yeah.net; 735963289@qq.com; 2553975137@qq.com; R.Jin@brighton.ac.uk; K.I.Gidado@brighton.ac.uk; N.J.Painting@brighton.ac.uk; yangyangcqu@cqu.edu.cn; l.yan@tu-braunschweig.de,"Yan, Libo/AAF-8243-2020; Jin, Ruoyu/K-6433-2019; Jin, Ruoyu/A-8520-2017","Yan, Libo/0000-0002-8974-414X; Painting, Noel/0000-0002-0432-7639; Jin, Ruoyu/0000-0003-0360-6967; Gidado, Kassim/0000-0002-1816-9686",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51408266]; Ministry of Education in China (MOE) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [14YJCZH047]; Foundation of Jiangsu University [14JDG012]; Writing Retreat Fund by the University of Brighton,"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51408266), the Ministry of Education in China (MOE) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Grant No. 14YJCZH047), the Foundation of Jiangsu University (Grant No. 14JDG012), and the Writing Retreat Fund provided by the University of Brighton.",,57,10,10,9,49,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Recently, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is remarked as an efficient and reliable construction management tool. This study investigates the role of BIM in identifying schedule risks and providing an effective solution for schedule management. Thus, key project delay factors and their remedying BIM features have been studied through literature and primary data, and a factor-feature matrix is developed.

This rigid representation, however, does not consider the situation when two activities have a degree of flexibility in their relationship. Such flexibility, or soft relation, can be very beneficial as it provides a range of overlapping options that can be utilized in situations that require the schedule to be optimally accelerated. This paper thus proposes a formalization of a generic logical relationship (hard or soft) of any type (finish-to-start, etc.) between any two activities. Using the generic representation, modified activity start and finish time computations are presented to accommodate the overlaps associated with soft relations, and are used in a schedule-crashing model. The model determines the optimum combination of activity crashing and overlapping decisions that minimizes project cost without violating the resource constraints. The new activity relationship and crashing model are beneficial to both researchers and practitioners as they facilitate schedule optimization decisions for projects that exercise a good level of overlapping, such as fast-track projects.","[Abuwarda, Zinab; Hegazy, Tarek] Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Hegazy, T (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",zabuward@uwaterloo.ca; tarek@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,24,7,8,0,19,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The duration of a delay is an essential piece of information required for determining the cause of a delay. However, it is difficult to analyze a delay claim due to the fact that numerous factors that cause this delay, thereby making it a very complex issue. One of such factors is the lost productivity or loss of productivity. Despite the fact that it is one of the major causes of delay, there have been only a few studies that focus on converting lost productivity into delay duration carried out to date. Claims for productivity losses are generally the result of tension between the contractor and the owner. This tension arises due to the great difficulty involved in quantifying disruption effects. Thus, to calculate accurately the delay duration, a logical method for analyzing schedule delay caused by lost productivity is necessary. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method for analyzing construction schedule delay where this lost productivity is taken into consideration. This methodology was implemented on a case project to ascertain its practicability, and to decide whether it can be utilized in the case of a delay claim related to lost productivity. The significance of this paper is twofold. One is the method to convert the lost productivity into the delay duration, which can be applied to reasonable delay claim settlement. The other is the process to analyze the construction schedule delay considering lost productivity.","Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Architecture, Seoul 151742, South Korea; Kwangwoon Univ, Dept Architecture Engn, Seoul 139701, South Korea; Hanyang Univ, Coll Architecture, Seoul 133791, South Korea","Lee, HS (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Architecture, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",hyunslee@snu.ac.kr; hglyu@cricmail.net; myazure@cricmail.net; jjkim@hanyang.ac.kr,"Kim, Jae-Jun/E-9063-2013","Yu, Jung-Ho/0000-0001-5514-9409",,,,16,18,18,1,15,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Traditional network scheduling techniques are ineffective in modeling the dynamic nature and resource interactions of large or multiunit projects. This paper presents a simulation-based auction protocol (SBAP) to solve resource scheduling problems in large-scale construction projects. SBAP is a hybrid framework that integrates multi agent resource allocation (MARA) in a simulation environment. SBAP deploys a centralized resource allocation approach, referred to as an auction protocol, whereby agents bid on different combinations of resources at the start of a simulation cycle. Agents attempt to improve their individual welfare by acquiring a combination of resources; an auctioneer looks at the entire system and allocates resources to the agents using a combinatorial algorithm to maximize an overall objective function (e.g., maximizing the system's revenue or minimizing total costs). The auction is repeated on a regular basis. Simulation is also employed in large-scale projects to track the availability of resources, capture and release the resources, and satisfy constraints of the problem. This paper demonstrates the architecture of the SBAP framework and discusses implementation of SBAP in a real case study of crane allocation in an industrial project.

Each module is a project with its own activities and constraints. These modules are prefabricated offsite, at a location called the module assembly yard, and then shipped to the site. Effective scheduling of modules of an industrial plant involves developing a realistic schedule that makes best use of limited resources in the yard while satisfying the constraints and uncertainties of the entire project. Scheduling such large-scale, multiunit projects using commercial CPM-based scheduling applications (e.g.,Primavera, Microsoft Project) is not effective. In previous work, we have introduced a hybrid framework, called simulation-based auction protocol (SBAP), for effective resource scheduling in large-scale projects. The present study employs the SBAP framework for effective allocation of resources (e.g.,space, skilled crew) and for satisfaction of various constraints. This system pulls data from a comprehensive database, runs the simulation model behind the scenes, and generates various graphical reports to aid superintendents and project managers in pertinent project decisions. The developed system is also capable of scheduling the fast-track modular construction projects with limited data available, doing effective resource leveling, and scheduling resources (e.g.,space, crew) effectively based on various shifts and calendars.

This, in effect, contradicts real-world practice where workers may possess multiple skills and, on several occasions, are assigned to perform tasks for which they are not specialized. Past research has shown a simple process of heuristic approach for multi-skilled resource scheduling where a project is planned under the assumption that each resource can have more than one skill and resource substitution is allowed. Nevertheless, the approach has presented resource substitution step where an activity with higher priority can claim any resource regardless of its concurrent activities' resource requirements. Furthermore, the approach is subjected to all-or-nothing resource assignment concept where an activity cannot start and resources are not needed for that activity at all unless the required resources of that activity can be completely fulfilled. This research presents an alternative heuristic approach for multi-skilled resource scheduling in an attempt to improve the resource substitution approach. Augmented resource substitution rule and resource-driven task duration are presented to increase starting opportunity of activities on earlier time.

In order to achieve a balance between these objectives, several multiple-objective construction scheduling models have been reported in the literature. However, several challenges have been encountered, due to the complexities of modelling and visualizing more than three objectives simultaneously. Some of these challenges are addressed in this work via the development of a many-objective scheduling model (MOSM) based on a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for the simultaneous optimization of four objectives: time, cost, resources and environmental impact. Coordinate plots are used to visualize the trade-offs made between all four of these objectives. A weighted sum is introduced that offers the project team the freedom to choose an optimal solution, depending on the specific priorities of the project, and the practical application of the model is demonstrated via a case study. Our MOSM allows the optimal outcome to be achieved in construction projects with multiple objectives.","[Panwar, Abhilasha; Jha, Kumar Neeraj] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110016, India","Panwar, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110016, India.",apanwar38@gmail.com,"Panwar, Abhilasha/ABA-6902-2020","Jha, Kumar Neeraj/0000-0002-1266-0132; Panwar, Abhilasha/0000-0002-4293-5061",,,,44,8,9,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

However, there is no accepted industry wide definition for safety culture. There is also no clear distinction between safety culture and safety climate. So far, little research has investigated how safety programs can be developed to improve safety culture and climate, which in turn can be used to assess the effectiveness of these programs. This paper presents a study that examined the multilevel safety culture and climate to assess a newly launched safety program. Specifically, three different questionnaires were used to survey 71 top executives, 229 site management personnel, and 350 field workers, respectively. This study found wide acceptance of the program across all three groups, strong management accountability in enforcing safety, and a positive general safety climate among workers. The results demonstrated the program's overall effectiveness in building positive safety culture and climate despite a few identified weaknesses. Based on these findings and insightful employee feedback, this paper offers generalized recommendations to help industry practitioners develop high-quality safety programs. The presented survey instruments and analysis methods can also be used to holistically assess safety programs and related safety culture and climate.

An empirical analysis on the role of unlearning and counter-knowledge,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Prefabrication; organisational readiness; unlearning; counter knowledge,,"Despite the recognised benefits of more extensive use of prefabrication in construction projects, a widespread market transformation has yet to occur. One of the key barriers to more extensive adoption of prefabrication is the resistance to practice change within the contractors' firms. Organisational readiness (OR) has been known as the antecedent to the success of practice change. This paper reports a study that aims to examine the factors affecting contractors' OR for more extensive use of prefabrication in projects. Backed by the literature review, a conceptual framework that depicts the inter-relationships among OR, unlearning (UL) and counter knowledge (CK) was proposed and empirically tested in this study. Data were collected from a questionnaire survey conducted in Australia. The results indicated that UL is positively correlated to OR. To build confidence in and gain acceptance by the employees within the contractor firms, long-term benefits for practice change should be articulated. Furthermore, the idea of more extensive use of prefabrication is less likely to be accepted when UL does not take place while CK is present. Inclusive communication within the contractor firms is vital to minimise employees' resistance to practice change. Coercive approaches to practice change, however, may negatively affect OR.","[Wong, Peter S.

A case study is used to apply the UPOEM to verify the practical implementation in a real project and from which a comparative experimental study and questionnaire survey were conducted. The findings indicate that the UPOEM can help generate more suggestions for improving design solution during designer-client communication compared with traditional approach.

This systematic approach helps the user create quality work plans and learn from understanding reasons for failure.

Previous studies lacked in-depth explorations of stakeholder perceptions to help elaborate the development requirements and dialectics of construction robots. This paper examined stakeholder perceptions of future construction robots for buildings within the Hong Kong context theoretically based on a dialectical system framework that incorporates the technical systems, stakeholders, and contexts. The study was conducted through a questionnaire survey with wide-ranging industry stakeholders that yielded 166 effective responses and 20 follow-up interviews for generating insights. The results indicate that construction robots have minimal application but are perceived to be important, particularly in off-site production and on-site lifting. The findings reveal the multidimensional complexity of task-oriented technical systems and the influencing contexts of construction robots, and demonstrate their dialectical relationship. Recommendations are offered for promoting robot applications, which include leveraging government support, capitalizing on off-site construction, encouraging technology adaptation, and driving task-technology integrative and iterative design. This paper contributes to the literature on construction robotics by proposing a novel dialectical system framework and providing new insights for future research and development.

The supply chains of PBPs involve large numbers of stakeholders, including clients, designers, main contractors, transporters, and assembly subcontractors, all of which need to interact with each other by frequent information exchanges. However, cross-border supply chains are found to be quite complex, resulting in risks that significantly affect the performance of PBPs. Supply chain risks (SCRs) are closely associated with the stakeholders involved and have high interdependency with each other. This paper adopts social network analysis (SNA) to develop the risk network of the supply chain of a PBP in Hong Kong to prioritize the stakeholder-associated SCR. The research findings show that poor planning of resources and schedule, poor control of working flows, and poor information sharing between stakeholders are the major challenges to the supply chains of PBPs. This is the first study to consider the dynamic risk interdependency and associated stakeholders in SCRs. By providing a greater understanding of the risks embedded across the supply chains of PBPs in Hong Kong, this study could assist practitioners dealing with such risks more effectively and efficiently.","[Luo, Lizi] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Room ZN1004,Block Z, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Shen, Geoffrey Qiping] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Room ZS732,Block Z, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Gangyan] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, E422B,HIT Campus, Shenzhen 518000, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yunlin] Anhui Jianzhu Univ, Sch Civil Engn, 292 Ziyun Rd, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yingjie] Huifeng Ctr, Room 1001,G Area,Tiyu Rd, Dongguan 523073, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Shen, GQ (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Room ZS732,Block Z, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lizi.luo@connect.polyu.hk; bsqpshen@polyu.edu.hk; gagexgy@gmail.com; kzdy@ahjzu.edu.cn; wyjcqu@hotmail.com,"Xu, Gangyan/A-2075-2016; Shen, Geoffrey Qiping/A-1250-2014","Xu, Gangyan/0000-0001-9537-9006; Shen, Geoffrey Qiping/0000-0002-3111-2019; Luo, Lizi/0000-0001-7097-9515",China Thirteenth Five-Year Plan National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC0701601],The authors appreciate the financial support of the China Thirteenth Five-Year Plan National Key Research and Development Program (Project 2016YFC0701601).,,109,50,50,47,292,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

The concept of influence is broken down into criteria, evaluating different aspects that together define an index which measures the influence of each stakeholder with respect to the rest of the project team. This index is calculated with the Analytic Network Process. The methodology has been applied to a maintenance project for the Spanish National Railway Infrastructure company. Results show that the most influential stakeholders are the Contractor and the Signaling systems provider accounting for 40% of the total influence. These results have helped the Project Manager to be aware of the two most influential stakeholders and set the guidelines for the stakeholder management in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Several studies have investigated the causes with insufficient evidence and impassive in the possible policy solutions, thus, the issues remain. This paper attempts to identify the root cause and proffer possible policy solutions via an unexplored exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach. First, 40 participants were engaged and the qualitative findings were further analyzed by 149 suitable retrieved questionnaires. The 'quantilized findings' were validated by the Malaysian LCH policymakers. Findings show that provision of land and capital facilities to utility companies by housing developers, scarcity of land in cities, and construction cost increased over the years are the three major causes of high development cost. Waiving all forms of taxes for LCH, housing developers to embrace industrialized building systems, utility companies should provide land for their infrastructure and absorb the construction cost, ceiling price should be revised upward to RM65,000-RM70,000/unit (RM4.10/US$1) while the government subsidizes housing costs among others were recommended.

Quantifying the influence of stakeholders on energy efficiency of housing allows for the development of an engagement plan that takes into consideration stakeholders' diverse goals, needs, levels of expertise, knowledge, authority, connectivity and closeness to decision-making processes throughout the different stages of the housing procurement. We present a theoretical approach for quantifying the influence of stakeholders on the thermal performance of housing. The quantification methodology builds on a number of stakeholder management approaches and is applied to Australian case studies for reflection and sense making. The quantification of the degree of influence is calculated by combining the rankings of stakeholders in six attributes that affect their influence on a building's energy efficiency outcomes. Quantifying human influence on buildings' energy efficiency can help future researchers and housing industry stakeholders in integrating the human aspect with technological, technical, economic and regulatory aspects to optimize the performance outcomes of energy efficient housing.","[Zedan, Sherif; Miller, Wendy] Queensland Univ Technol, Sci & Engn Fac, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Zedan, S (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sci & Engn Fac, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",sherif.lashen@hdr.qut.edu.au,,"Miller, Wendy/0000-0003-0863-4991",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [ARC LP 130100650],This work was supported by The Australian Research Council [grant number ARC LP 130100650].,,69,9,9,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Stakeholder attributes are socially constructed variables and have been classified as power, legitimacy and urgency based on stakeholder theory. They are not the only factors to predict the overall performance of a project, the environmental factors such as socio-economic and project conditions should also be considered. We, therefore, hypothesised that direct relationship between stakeholder attributes and performance of disaster recovery projects might be mediated by socio-economic and transport infrastructure conditions. Using structural equation modelling with partial least square estimation approach, we analysed data collected from structured questionnaire survey involving local councils in New South Wales, Australia. The results suggest that stakeholders with more power, legitimacy and urgency attributes have managed disaster recovery projects with better performance.

Design/ methodology/approach -This study used a sequential data collection approach by employing an in-depth semi-structured interview and questionnaire, respectively. Based on insight from the literature review, interviews were held with participants to solicit their perceptions about the failure of Ghanaian Government projects. A questionnaire was developed based on the results from the interviews in order to determine the relative importance of the various failure criteria used as the evaluation tool. Findings -Six main criteria were identified and used as the assessment framework for Ghanaian Government project failure. The findings indicated that Ghanaian Government projects fail on all the six failure criteria; however, the extent of failure differs from criterion to criterion. The worst failure criterion is meeting the projected timescale. This is followed by cost, requirement, stakeholder satisfaction, national development and contribution to the sector where projects are implemented, respectively. Practical implications -From this study, government project practitioners and policy makers will be able identify the failure areas ( criteria) on which to focus during government project implementation. Originality/ value -Though extant literature has been devoted to the success/ failure criteria, attention has not been paid to comparison of the extent of failure within these criteria in government projects. Therefore, this study extends the literature in this regard as well as government project failure literature in general.","[Damoah, Isaac Sakyi; Akwei, Cynthia] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Dept Business & Management, Liverpool, Merseyside, England","Damoah, IS (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Dept Business & Management, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",damoah@gmail.com,,,,,,132,12,12,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

However, PPPs are being plagued with controversy as some of them were subjected to project overruns and/or poor operations. An underlying issue contributing to unsatisfactory performance of PPPs was a result of an ambiguous accountability of the government. Despite this, limited empirical research has been undertaken to identify the government's accountability within PPPs. Thus, a conceptual framework of the accountability of the government of PPPs is developed in this paper and then examined by conducting a case study of a Chinese PPP project. The findings indicate that the government's accountability in PPPs should shift to enhance the effectiveness of quality services and the efficiency of use of public resources for asset end-users and general population.

A plethora of international construction studies seems to assume risks as independent and therefore, risk intervention strategies are usually critiqued as ineffective. Design/methodology/approach In the risk assessment stage, a multi-tiered risk network structure was developed with the project objectives, risk events, risk factors and stakeholders, and critical risk factors were selected based on a series of calculations. In the risk intervention stage, targeted risk intervention strategies were proposed for stakeholders based on the results of the first stage. A highway construction project in Eastern Europe was selected as a case study. Findings The results showed that 17 risk factors in three categories - external, stakeholder-related and internal - are critical, and the project manager, construction management department, supplier and contract department are the most critical stakeholders that affect the entire project performance. Based on the critical risk factors and project stakeholders, targeted risk intervention strategies were proposed. The risk assessment results of MNA were found to be more reliable and consistent with the project conditions than the risk matrix method; the risk intervention strategies of MNA can effectively address project objectives. Originality/value This study modeled risk priorities based on risk associations and put forward a new method for risk management, supplementing the body of knowledge of international construction.

As part of a large study, the authors developed and implemented a 5-h training program to improve construction supervisors' safety-efficacy, in order to enhance the safety climate on construction worksites. The training program covered fall prevention, silica exposure, leadership, communication, and safety planning. This study evaluated pretraining and posttraining changes and safety-efficacy six months posttraining. A total of 118 supervisors, contractors, and workers from more than 50 construction firms in Massachusetts attended the training. Statistically significant improvements were observed in participants' safety knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Six-months postintervention, 58% of supervisors, contractors, or both, perceived that the training contributed a lot to their ability to communicate effectively with Spanish-speaking workers, to take on a safety leadership role (52%), and to conduct effective training (62%). This study determined that when supervisors perceive that they have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to make changes, they may better fulfill their role as a safety leader. Construction supervisor training courses might be revised to include leadership and effective communication topics.

In the construction industry, many accident investigations reveal that workers' unsafe behaviors are the most frequent and direct causes of on-site accidents, and thus need to be addressed urgently. Based on cognitive and social psychology theories and existing accident causation models, this paper develops a CM-CWUB by adopting a five-stage form, specifically representing the construction workers' cognitive processes when confronted with potential hazards on construction sites. Using a cognitive perspective can reveal the mechanism of human error and thus can elucidate how unsafe behaviors are produced. The five stages include obtaining information, understanding information, perceiving responses, selecting response, and taking action, with obtaining information and selecting response as the two key stages. Obtaining information elaborates construction workers' observations and processing of hazard information on sites by themselves, and selecting response adopts the theory of planned behavior to reflect various factors of influence when workers select unsafe behavior. Based on the developed model, cognitive failures that would lead to construction workers' unsafe behaviors at different cognitive stages are then systematically analyzed.","[Fang, Dongping; Zhao, Chen; Zhang, Mengchun] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management, Tsinghua Gammon Construct Safety Res Ctr, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Fang, DP (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management, Tsinghua Gammon Construct Safety Res Ctr, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",fangdp@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51378296, 71172013, 50978155, 71572088]","The authors would like to hereby thank Dr. Robert Webber of Tsinghua University for his careful editing and Mr. Qun Li in BCEG for his valuable suggestions for this research.

Traditionally, safety has been measured and managed reactively, where actions are taken in response to adverse trends in injuries. Alternatively, safety-related practices can be measured during the construction phase to trigger positive responses before an injury occurs. Despite the potential benefits of such strategies, few have been identified in the literature and there has yet to be an organized effort to codify and investigate these methods. A mixed-methods research approach was used to (1)clearly identify and define elements of the safety management process that can be measured and monitored during the construction phase, (2)describe resource requirements for measurement, monitoring, and response, and (3)describe specific management actions required when any indicator fails to satisfy a desired value. To produce internally and externally valid and reliable results, data were triangulated from case studies, content analysis of award-winning projects, and focused discussions among construction safety experts. In total, over 50 proactive metrics were identified, 13 of which were selected as top priority by expert professionals. Use of these indicators has been connected to exceptional safety performance in industry-leading organizations. The implication of the findings is that very strong safety outcomes can be expected if contractors build upon a robust safety management foundation with the use of these methods of project safety control.","[Hallowell, Matthew R.; Baud, Kevin C.] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hinze, Jimmie W.; Wehle, Andrew] Univ Florida, Rinker Sch Bldg Construct, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Hallowell, MR (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, 428 UCB,1111 Engn Dr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",matthew.hallowell@colorado.edu; hinze@ufl.edu; baud.kevin@gmail.com; wehleaj@ufl.edu,"Hallowell, Matthew R/G-7918-2016",,Construction Industry Institute,"The writers would like to thank the Construction Industry Institute for providing support for this research.

A challenge with using SRM in practice arises when faced with the uniqueness of construction organizations. Distinctive practices and cultures affect the availability and quantity of data, which in turn limits the reliability of conventional SRM-based evaluation methods. This study proposes a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach that makes efficient use of existing SRM available within an organization to reliably evaluate safety performance. The model was validated using statistical tests to compare model output with actual performance. To test model applicability, we conducted a case study: based on information available in an industrial construction organization, including schedule performance and payroll data, 27 measures were identified. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach is able to evaluate safety performance trends in consideration of unique organizational characteristics using SRM. We expect that the model approach and results will support managers in tailoring safety goals and programs to particular contexts.","[Pereira, Estacio; AbouRizk, Simaan] Univ Alberta, Hole Sch Construct Engn, 7-203 D ICE,9211 116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada; [Hermann, Ulrich] PCL Ind Management Inc, Construct Engn, 9925 56 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6E 3P4, Canada; [Han, SangUk] Hanyang Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 133791, South Korea","AbouRizk, S (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Hole Sch Construct Engn, 7-203 D ICE,9211 116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada.",estacio@ualberta.ca; RHHermann@pcl.com; sanguk@hanyang.ac.kr; abourizk@ualberta.ca,"Pereira, Estacio/S-9092-2017","Pereira, Estacio/0000-0002-1654-1827; AbouRizk, Simaan/0000-0002-4788-9121",PCL Industrial Management Inc.; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [CRDPJ 492657],This work was generously supported by PCL Industrial Management Inc. and was funded by a Collaborative Research and Development Grant (CRDPJ 492657) from NSERC.

II: Group Analyses for the Effects of Cultural Backgrounds and Organizational Structures on Social Influence Process,JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Safety management; Safety behavior; Social influence; Cultural difference; Organizational structure; Labor and personnel issues,GROUP SELF-ESTEEM; NATIONAL CULTURE; INDIVIDUALISM-COLLECTIVISM; DISTINCT ASPECTS; CLIMATE; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; CATEGORIZATION; CONSEQUENCES,"The roles of perceived management norm, perceived workgroup norm, and project identity in construction workers' safety behavior were described in the companion paper. That paper found that workers who strongly identify with their project demonstrate a stronger association between strict perceived management norms and safety behavior and a diminished association between lenient perceived workgroup norms and safety behavior. However, it is still unclear whether the findings are stable across different cultural backgrounds and organizational structures. To address this issue, this study aims to compare the roles of perceived management norm, perceived workgroup norm, and project identity in workers' safety behavior in different cultural backgrounds and organizational structures. The surveys were conducted in the United States, Korea, and Saudi Arabia for the group analyses because the three countries are both different from and similar to each other in terms of cultural backgrounds and organizational structure. The result demonstrated a significant relationship between social norms (e.g.,perceived management norms and perceived workgroup norms) and safety behavior, but cultural and organizational contexts can make a difference in the social influence processes. It was found that workers' social identification with their projects functions as an important mechanism that moderates the relationship between social norms and safety behavior in the United States and Korea. Just as the individualistic culture in the United States leads to significant direct effects of attitudes on safety behavior, the collectivistic culture in Korea brings about the significant effects of the perceived management norm and perceived workgroup norm on safety behavior. On the other hand, in Saudi Arabia, although workers already have a salient project identity due to its system of direct hiring, interactions between project identity and social norms do not have significant associations with safety behavior because perceived management norms may not be strict enough to elicit behavioral changes in improving safety behavior. The findings from this study lay a theoretical foundation for a new approach to safety management in international construction projects. Beyond the sociopsychological aspect of safety behavior, considerations of cultural and organization context would be essential to strengthen positive social influence on workers' safety behavior in international construction projects.

Yet, both the characterization of industry environments and evidence of how they evolve over time has been decidedly mixed. This reflects the limitations and overreliance on linear methods in management research. In this paper, we introduce nonlinear dynamical system methods from complexity theory as an alternative to characterize and operationalize industry environments. We identify three measures employed regularly in disciplines ranging from medicine to physics to identify nonlinear patterns in data. Using data from 19 key industry sectors over 36 years, we demonstrate how this method can be used to examine how industry environments evolve. Our results indicate that industry environments evolve as chaotic systems with unpredictability commensurate with characterizations of hypercompetition. Furthermore, we observe that this unpredictability is widespread across multiple industry sectors, and not relegated to a selected group of industry environments. However, we do observe variation in the level of complexity and sensitivity to initial conditions across industry sectors. Finally, we find no evidence that the level of unpredictability of these environments was increasing over the time period studied.","[Ndofor, Hermann Achidi] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Fabian, Frances] Univ Memphis, Fogelman Coll Business & Econ, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Michel, John G.] Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Ndofor, HA (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",hndofor@iu.edu; ffabian@memphis.edu; jmichel@nd.edu,"Fabian, Frances H./B-9188-2013","Ndofor, Hermann/0000-0002-4933-3442; Fabian, Frances/0000-0002-0634-255X",,,,100,2,2,1,20,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Collaboration is viewed as a system of behaviours that includes both social and solitary work. The social aspects of collaboration arc discussed in terms of three dimensions: awareness, brief interaction and collaboration (working together). Current knowledge on the links between space and the social as well as individual aspects of collaborative work is reviewed. The central conflict of collaboration is considered: how to design effectively to provide a balance between the need to interact and the need to work effectively by oneself. The body of literature shows that features and attributes of space can be manipulated to increase awareness, interaction and collaboration. However, doing so frequently has negative impacts on individual work as a result of increases in noise distractions and interruptions to on-going work. The effects are most harmful for individual tasks requiring complex and focused mental work.

The relationship between stakeholder interests and demonstrating results in international development,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Success; Complexity; Stakeholder; Results; Demonstrating; Non-profit,PROJECTS,"Purpose - Many development interventions fail to report results that are important to local people (intended beneficiaries of the intervention) but not of strategic importance to the donors funding the work. Failure to report unexpected results, or those not linked to strategic goals, contributes to an overly negative view from external evaluations by donors and agencies. The causes of the mismatch between actual and demonstrated results failure were studied through stakeholder interests. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Nine project and programme managers of similar but unrelated projects were interviewed. From the interviews, previous studies and project publications, the challenges posed by differing interests and different perceptions in reporting stakeholder activities, outputs and outcomes, were identified. The complex environment of many development interventions was analysed and the work was contextualised with a peacebuilding project in Sri Lanka, which the author has previously studied. A stakeholder role and perception analysis was used to map the challenges at four times in the project cycle, producing a dynamic stakeholder analysis. Findings - The failure to fully report intervention results was linked to the changing role of competing stakeholder interests as a project proceeds, the conflicting perceptions of stakeholders, the structural over-simplification of a complex environment and power differentials that allow donors to misappropriate the role of clients. Practical implications - Current practice in designing and evaluating projects needs to improve reporting of beneficiary interests. Originality/value - To the author's knowledge there are no prior publications in this area of research (under-reporting of development intervention results); the paper is considered highly original.","[Julian, Rachel] Leeds Beckett Univ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England","Julian, R (corresponding author), Leeds Beckett Univ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",R.julian@leedsbeckett.ac.uk,,"Julian, Rachel/0000-0003-4766-777X",,,,53,7,7,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

From a technology diffusion perspective, this paper proposes a game theory-based model including two firms who both are potential BIM adopters under support from the government (i.e., subsidy). Two influential factors affecting AEC firms' BIM adoption decisions are identified, including BIM adoption efficiency and adoption incentives. Through analyzing the model with a backward-induction method, AEC firms' best responses of joining time and the government's optimal subsidizing strategies are discussed. The findings show that the government subsidy is effective in promoting BIM adoption because the subsidy can both bring forward the joining time and enhance BIM adoption efficiency by offsetting firms' setup costs. Under the government's subsidy policies, AEC firms that are originally negative toward BIM adoption can become positive, which demonstrates the occurrence of BIM technology diffusion. Theoretical and practice implications are also discussed. This study contributes to a new perspective for understanding BIM adoption behaviors among AEC firms. In addition, the study for the first time introduces game theory into explaining BIM adoption and diffusion, which may benefit BIM implementation and enhance the effectiveness of policies aiming at promoting BIM application practices.","[Yuan, Hongping; Yang, Yu] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 610000, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Yuan, HP (corresponding author), Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 610000, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",hpyuan2005@gmail.com,"杨, 宇/N-3905-2016","Yuan, Hongping/0000-0002-2383-4249",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71573216],This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71573216).,,64,14,14,17,111,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The proposed system uses wearable sensors, Vive trackers, machine learning and virtual reality to track body kinematics, and engagement with physical construction resources, and provides feedback via an interactive user interface. The postural training system was developed for training workers engaged in wood frame construction. User study of the effectiveness of the feedback and user interface was conducted. Findings showed that the user interface was perceived as convenient with limited interference with the workspace. The feedback was understandable in learning risks associated with participant's postures.

When hazards remain unrecognized, or the associated safety risk is underestimated, the likelihood of catastrophic and unexpected injuries dramatically increase. Unfortunately, recent research has found that a large number of hazards in construction remain unrecognized. Likewise, past studies have demonstrated that safety risk is widely underestimated within construction. To improve hazard recognition and the accurate perception of safety risk, employers adopt a wide variety of training programs. However, the prevalent use of ineffective and unengaging training methods have significantly impeded training efforts in construction. The purpose of this research was to assess the impact of safety training on two objective training outcomes: hazard recognition performance and safety risk perception. The research objectives were accomplished by gathering empirical data from 51 active projects in the United States. Specifically, data pertaining to the training method (i.e.,high-engagement versus low-engagement training) adopted at the project level were gathered, following which the hazard recognition ability of representative workers and their safety risk perception levels were measured. The results of the study revealed that (1)compared to low-engagement training, high-engagement training is associated with higher levels of hazard recognition and safety risk perception; and (2)the effect of training on safety risk perception is mediated by hazard recognition performance. Therefore, workers representing projects that offered high-engagement training were able to identify a larger proportion of hazards, and consequently perceived that safety risk was relatively higher. The findings of this study will be useful to practicing professionals seeking to improve training delivery, hazard recognition performance, and the perception of safety risk within construction. This study represents the first formal attempt to empirically evaluate the holistic relationship between training, hazard recognition, and safety risk perception in the construction context.","[Namian, Mostafa; Albert, Alex; Zuluaga, Carlos M.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 2501 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA; [Behm, Michael] East Carolina Univ, Dept Technol Syst, 1001 E 5th St, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Albert, A (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 2501 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA.",mnamian@ncsu.edu; alex_albert@ncsu.edu; cmzuluag@ncsu.edu; behmm@ecu.edu,,"Namian, Mostafa/0000-0003-1375-8761; Zuluaga, Carlos M./0000-0001-8927-2819",,,,49,51,52,8,88,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The high rates of workplace injuries, illnesses and fatalities cause irreversible harm to workers and are often the source of delays and additional project costs. Improvements in sensor technologies, wireless communication, the processing power of computers, and advancements in machine learning and computer vision are now enabling the development of sensor-based safety management systems. The rapid growth of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has also created opportunities for improving safety management. While considerable progress has been made to improve construction safety, few studies have focused on the integration of sensor-based systems and BIM. This research, which is motivated by the development of such integrated methods, carries out a systematic review of the relevant literature, summarising recent developments of sensor-based safety management systems and advancements in safety management through BIM. The research gaps are identified and an outline for potential future research is provided.

A multi-objective decision making model is established in which the total project duration is regarded as a fuzzy variable. To deal with the uncertainty, the fuzzy numbers in the model are defuzzified by using an expected value operator with an optimistic pessimistic index. The objective functions are to minimize the total project cost, project duration, crashing cost, and environmental impact. Furthermore, a fuzzy-based adaptive-hybrid genetic algorithm is developed to find feasible solutions. The one-point crossover and repairing strategy for mutations are designed to avoid infeasible solutions. Finally, the Jinping-II Hydroelectric Project is used as a practical example to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the model. Results and a sensitivity analysis are presented to highlight the performance of the optimization method, which proves to be very effective and efficient compared to other algorithms.

Existing established methods of assessing fatigue include surveys and questionnaires, which are cumbersome to implement at construction sites. This study presents a novel approach for real time monitoring of physical fatigue in construction workers using wearable sensors. Changes in the heart rate, thermoregulation and electrical brain activity during a simulated construction task were monitored from 12 participants using a heart rate monitor, infrared temperature sensors and an EEG sensor. Borg's RPE was used as a subjective scale to collect the level of fatigue experienced by the participants. Boosted tree classifiers were trained using the features extracted from the heart rate and temperature sensor signals and used to predict the level of physical fatigue. Only physical fatigue was assessed as none of the participants developed any sign of mental fatigue during the study. The results show that physical fatigue can be monitored using wearable sensors. The classification accuracy, based solely on features extracted from average of skin temperature data, was 9% higher than based solely on heart rate data, and combining the information from both sensors resulted in the best accuracy of 82%. The results also show that monitoring thermoregulation from temple can be more useful compared to other studied monitoring sites, the classification accuracy based only on data from the temple was 79%. This accuracy is significantly higher compared to the classification accuracy based only on heart rate data (59%). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Predominantly, workers leave the workforce because of injuries. In particular, musculoskeletal disorders are depleting the construction workforce. Previous studies have contrasted the safety records of journeymen versus novices. However, no study to date has examined the combined effects of experience level on safety, productivity, and the balance between them. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap and to investigate the underlying reasons for these effects. Twenty-one masons distributed in four experience levels were recruited to build a 72-block six-course wall using standard concrete masonry units. Participants' body kinematics were tracked using inertial measurement units and video cameras simultaneously. Biomechanical analysis was carried out to examine the loads experienced by major body joints during bricklaying. Results indicate that journeymen with more than 5 years of experience as well as novice masons work in ergonomically safer ways than apprentices with 1 and 3 years of experience. It was found that apprentices gain proficiency and increase productivity at the cost of higher risk of musculoskeletal injury. The results indicate that those masons who gain experience in ergonomic safety and productivity in tandem are more likely to remain in the workforce beyond the 5-year mark. Thus, it is essential to alter apprentice training to guarantee this outcome.

In this regard, an electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely applied to assess individuals' stress by analyzing brain waves in the clinical domains. With recent advancements in wearable EEG devices, EEG's ability can be extended to field workers, particularly by non-invasively assessing construction workers' stress. This study proposes a procedure to automatically recognize workers' stress in construction sites using EEG signals. Specifically, the authors collected construction field workers' EEG signals and preprocessed them to capture high-quality signals. Workers' salivary cortisol, a stress hormone, was also collected to label low or high-stress levels when they work at sites. Time and frequency domain features from EEG signals were calculated using fixed and sliding windowing approaches. Finally, the authors applied several supervised learning algorithms to recognize workers' stress while they are working at sites. The results showed that the fixed windowing approach and the Gaussian Support Vector Machine (SVM) yielded the highest classification accuracy of 80.32%, which is very promising given the similar accuracy of stress recognition in clinical domains where extricate and wired EEG devices were used and the subjects engage in minimal body movement. The results demonstrate that the proposed field stress recognition procedure can be used for the early detection of workers' stress, which can contribute to improving workers' safety, health, wellbeing, and productivity.","[Jebelli, Houtan] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tishman Construct Management Program, 2350 Hayward St,Suite 1316 GG Brown Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hwang, Sungjoo] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Architectural & Urban Syst Engn, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 03760, South Korea; [Lee, SangHyun] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tishman Construct Management Program, 2350 Hayward St,Suite 2340 GG Brown Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Lee, S (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tishman Construct Management Program, 2350 Hayward St,Suite 2340 GG Brown Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",hjebelli@umich.edu; hwangsj@ewha.ac.kr; shdpm@umich.edu,,"Lee, SangHyun/0000-0002-2246-7440",,,,55,85,87,14,72,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

There is only limited research on the usage of BIM in the construction phase, especially by site workers. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the use of BIM by site workers through so-called BIM-kiosks. The kiosks allow workers to access BIM models on-site. The aim of this paper is to take a closer look on the introduction of BIM-kiosks and scrutinize how and for what purpose site workers use the kiosks. Design/methodology/approach - This is a single case study of an ongoing real-world construction project. The case study is based on qualitative data which stems from observational studies, interviews as well as document studies. Findings - Site workers find opportunities for 3D visualization useful and the BIM models are appraised for efficiently handling complex elements. The findings also indicate that the use of BIM-kiosks lead to a greater level of face-to-face collaboration between workers on-site. This may happen because workers meet, both planned and randomly, to discuss in front of the kiosks while using it for visualization. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to a single case. However, some of the recommendations may be relevant to other projects. In addition, the findings demonstrate some of the potential of using BIM on-site in upcoming construction projects. Originality/value - Only a few studies have addressed the use of BIM among site workers. Thus, the findings provide practitioners and researchers insight into how current practices may be improved, as well as areas where more research is needed.","[Brathen, Ketil] Fafo, Oslo, Norway; [Moum, Anita] SINTEF Byggforsk, Oslo, Norway","Brathen, K (corresponding author), Fafo, Oslo, Norway.",keb@fafo.no,,,,,,32,11,11,7,52,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

The methodology is implemented in a real case study in order to verify its feasibility. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this case, conventional CPM/LOB schedules exhibit large time gaps, causing project delays. This paper proposes computational and geometrical enhancements to generate tightly-packed repetitive schedules, envisaged by the game of Tetris. The paper introduces novel procedures to overcome existing scheduling challenges: (1) revised computation to better determine tasks' delivery rates that meet deadlines; (2) formulation of mid-activity interruption time and mid-activity rate changes that synchronize task delivery rates; (3) multi-crew arrangement method, As Soon-As-Possible, that better suits non-identical units; and (4) a simplified heuristic combining all procedures above to generate tightly-packed schedules with shorter durations. As presented in the paper through examples, the proposed techniques reduce the duration of complex repetitive projects using enhanced schedule computation and geometry rather than using expensive acceleration/optimization methods.","[Hegazy, Tarek; Mostafa, Kareem; Ojulari, Saidat] Univ Waterloo, Civil & Env Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada","Mostafa, K (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Civil & Env Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",tarek@uwaterloo.ca; ktmostafa@uwaterloo.ca; sojulari@uwaterloo.ca,,"Mostafa, Kareem/0000-0002-7158-2197",,,,39,0,0,7,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Since the 1960s many optimization algorithms have been proposed to solve this NP-hard problem, and their performances are evaluated in well-known test problems with different complexities. Although it is desirable to find an algorithm which can provide promising solutions with reasonable computational efforts for any problem under consideration, no single algorithm can meet that condition. To deal with this challenge, we present a genetic algorithm based memetic algorithm (MA) for solving RCPSP. The algorithm is initiated by a critical path-based heuristic and a variant of the Nawaz, Enscore, and Ham (NEH) heuristic. The algorithm involves a similar block order crossover and a variable insertion based local search. An automatic restart scheme is also presented which assists the algorithm to escape from local optima. In addition, a design-of-experiment (DOE) method is used to determine the set of suitable parameters for the proposed MA. Numerical results, statistical analysis and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","[Rahman, Humyun Fuad; Chakrabortty, Ripon K.; Ryan, Michael J.] Univ New South Wales, Capabil Syst Ctr, Sch Engn & IT, Canberra, ACT 2610, Australia","Rahman, HF (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Capabil Syst Ctr, Sch Engn & IT, Canberra, ACT 2610, Australia.",humyun.fuad@adfa.edu.au,"Chakrabortty, Ripon K./ABA-6480-2020","Chakrabortty, Ripon K./0000-0002-7373-0149",,,,64,18,20,4,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

A procedure is proposed to transform an IDEF3 model into a set of alternative precedence networks, In the networks selected, the activities that are resource independent are grouped with a partitioning procedure.

Other factors such as network reliability, criticality, location, contract size, and rehabilitation method(s) affect the optimization of the scheduling process. This paper presents a method for optimized scheduling of rehabilitation work for water distribution networks. The method utilizes unsupervised neural networks (UNNs) and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) and performs the scheduling in two stages. In the first stage, UNNs are used to cluster water mains into groups according to locations and rehabilitation methods of water mains. In the second stage, MINLP is used to determine the number of rehabilitation contract packages and the generation of optimized scheduling of these packages considering network reliability, criticality, contract size, and planning time. In order to demonstrate the essential features of the developed method, a case study was analyzed and the results obtained are discussed; highlighting their utilization in practice.

Even though extensive research has been conducted on CSLP problems, the effect of the multi-stakeholder interactions on optimal site layout plans has been less studied. Therefore, this paper proposes an agent-based decentralized bi-level mathematical model that incorporates decisions from three stakeholders, to examine the CSLP multi-stakeholder interactions. To solve the model, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based solution approach is developed to generate the CSLP, construction material logistics planning (CMLP) and security planning (SP) solutions in an integrated CSLP-CMLP/SP system. Specifically, the stakeholders are modelled as individual agents with respective decisions and objective functions, and the inter-dependencies between the layout planner and the other two stakeholders (i.e. the logistics planner and the safety manager) are simultaneously incorporated and dealt with using the bi-level model. The multi-stakeholder interactions are realized by iteratively updating the individual decisions to determine an optimal integrated solution in which the potential stakeholder conflicts in the construction stage are minimized. A case study is given to validate the practicality of the designed model in addressing the CSLP-CMLP and CSLP-SP interactions. The contributions of this research are its applicability to model the effect of multi-stakeholder interactions in agent-based decentralized models, the design of a PSO-based solution approach to achieve an integrated CSLP-CMLP/SP solution, and the provision of academic and practical guidance for decision makers to further enrich global decentralized CSLP research.","[Song, Xiaoling; Zhang, Zhe] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Pena-Mora, Feniosky; Shen, Charles] Columbia Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Engn Mech, Adv ConsTruct & InfOrmat TechNol ACTION Lab, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Xu, Jiuping] Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Song, XL (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",songxiaoling@njust.edu.cn,,"Song, Xiaoling/0000-0001-8654-2932","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71801129, 71401075]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20180452]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [30918013103, JGQN1703]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under the Grant No. 71801129 and the Grant No. 71401075 and the Grant No. 71401075 the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under the Grant No. BK20180452, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under the Grant No. 30918013103 and the Grant No. JGQN1703.",,53,7,7,6,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.
